He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn‚Äôt until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I‚Äôm not powerless just because I was a kid. \n\n\n\nWhile it‚Äôs easy to write off comic books as a child‚Äôs entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes. Thanks to Stan, I‚Äôm able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what I‚Äôve come to call ‚ÄúPeter Parker Syndrome.‚Äù So, even beyond his personal impact on my own life, I owe Stan Lee a great debt. \n\n\n\nHis is an influence that will be missed. Marvel games, movies, and media at large will simply not be the same without him. Through the act of creating superheroes, Stan Lee himself became a superhero, a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world. May he Rest In Peace, but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come.\n\nEdit: since people were asking what ‚ÄúPeter Parker Syndrome‚Äù is, I‚Äôll copy/paste my response here. It‚Äôs an allegory I use to illustrate certain themes:\n\n\nIt‚Äôs how I explain codependency and hero complex to clients. \n\n\nI started by introducing Spider-Man and his real identity. I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the ‚Äúdisguise.‚Äù \n\n\nAnyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn‚Äôt care, because he gets to be the hero and that‚Äôs what matters most to him.\n\n\nTime passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can‚Äôt even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.\n\n\nThen the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.\n\nI then relate the client‚Äôs self care to their ‚ÄúPeter Parker‚Äù and their desire to be there and care for others to their ‚ÄúSpiderman,‚Äù to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.\n\n\nA seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around. I then have them keep a running tab of how Peter Parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care.', ""Stan Lee dying is like David Attenborough or the queen dying, I refuse to believe it's possible until it is"", 'I would feel like ""finally.

On July 18, 1863, the regiment was ordered to spearhead an assault on Fort Wagner. Shaw was killed during the initial charge as he led his men into battle.\n\nWhile the assault was initially successful, Union forces were eventually pushed back and Confederate troops held on to the fort. Common practice at the time was for fallen officers to be given an honorable burial, regardless of the side they were on. However, as Shaw led the first all-black regiment, commanding Confederate General Johnson Hagood did not deem him worthy of that honor, stating\n\n>Had he been in command of white troops, I should have given him an honorable burial; as it is, I shall bury him in the common trench with the niggers that fell with him.\n\nUnion troops tried to recover his body and give him a proper burial, but were unsuccessful. Hearing of this, Shaw\'s father sent a letter to the regimental surgeon, stating:\n\n>We would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave and devoted soldiers....We can imagine no holier place than that in which he lies, among his brave and devoted followers, nor wish for him better company. ‚Äì what a body-guard he has!\n\nAnd so, the act considered by General Hagood to be an insult, came to be seen as the greatest honor that could have been bestowed upon Shaw.\n\n----\n\nThe story of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment is memorialized in the film ""Glory"", starring Matthew Broderick as Shaw.', 'Col.

You think I can pack in a whole weekend fooling around camping with my kids??"" I basically thought (A) we probably don\'t want ya anyway, and (B) let\'s see what kind of nursing home your kids put you in some day.\n\nMy kids are now 27, 28 and 31 - they were all home for christmas and it was awesome, we spent so much time together, they had lists of the meals I needed to cook, invited kids I\'ve known for decades, I finally built a legit stone fire pit and we spent hours at night around the fire.

How would I even know what I\'m missing? The answer to which should be ""because I saw other kids interact with their dads"". But I didn\'t really. I would spend a fair amount of time hanging out at the places of my friends and I didn\'t even meet some of their fathers ever and when I did it was usually just a short greeting followed by them watching TV and us kids not being allowed to ""disturb dad because he is tired from work"".', 'Goddamn millennials and their...attentive parenting.', 'My dad never asked me ""how\'s your day"" or ""how do you feel"".

My husband did all of bathing, changing, nail trimming duties the first few months while I was being a delirious milk factory.

He can do everything if I were to leave house for any amount of time. \nThis is also cultural. \nI have a friend in her 40s, who is also a Russian immigrant in the US. \nThe other day she asked me to tell my husband to babysit our kid, so her and I can hang out.

By watching I mean just going over hanging for a few and feeding him, making sure he has enough water. \n\n\nOn one of these trips when I came over I noticed his bowls(food/water) were flipped over. They were two metal bowls that sat in a metal frame next eachother (connected) but now they were both out and on the floor. The food bowl was spilt and some food was out.

This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it\'s one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin\' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!\n\nNow what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can\'t escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the ""point of no return"" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn\'t actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can\'t escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it\'s estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).\n\nNow, on a more fundamental level than ""it\'s cool to have a picture of a black hole,"" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don\'t think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don\'t understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn\'t understand, and that we can\'t test in a lab on Earth because it\'s so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It\'s priceless!\n\nThird, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one\'s data (after it\'s shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet\'s too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I\'m frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I\'m not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)\n\nA final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it\'s limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it\'s relatively nearby at ""only"" 25,000 light years away.  M87\'s black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy\'s supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it\'s ~54 million light years).  The reason it\'s cool though is it\'s such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there\'s going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\n\nAnyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It\'s amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!\n\nTL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.\n\nEdit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn\'t also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It\'s not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.', 'I remember how vague the information about black holes was when I was at school, 20 to 25 years ago.

The student takes real classes from real professors. Your tuition waiver as a PhD student gives you those classes for free. So you can say you did receive something of value you weren\'t taxed on.\n\nHowever, once these class requirements are fulfilled, the PhD. student is now a full time research a assistant. A reasonable person might expect that the student now gets the money that used to go to their classes. Nope! They get a small pay bump of a few thousand a year when they make this status change.\n\nIn effect, once the ""student"" becomes a full research assistant their pay is cut massively because they aren\'t getting the full benefit of their tuition waiver anymore. However, the ""student"" needs to keep their student status so they make the ""student"" register for ""thesis/research credits"" which are billed at the same rate as real classes. But there is no classroom, no curriculum no homework, no exams. It\'s just there to keep student status but they charge for this and then waive it!

PhD students get their tuition paid for in exchange for TA-ing or some similar activity. The colleges and universities like this arrangement because it is tax advantageous for them. But they could just as easily award the PhD students a scholarship instead of a tuition waiver. Or - gasp - they could pay them a fair wage for the work they do.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not too up in arms about this bill.\n\n1. I doubt that the final bill will tax tuition waivers.\n\n2.

', 'I don\'t think it is fair to just throw the ""300% "" in the room without even mentioning HOW the increase works.\n\nThe taxhike is done by taxing graduate students who get their tuition as gift from the university.\n\nUniversities get around paying higher wages by basically deducting the tuition fee from the wage, but not calling it that. They just ""forgive"" the tuition fee, thus allowing them to pay lower wages, because students don\'t have to require wages to pay that tuition out of.\n\nFor the system that means basically the tuition gets removed from the system twice. As part of the wage, and as part of the revenue of the universities.\n\n**The outrage**: Taxing things that you DIDN\'T pay. If that logic was broadly applied, homeless people would have to pay taxes for meals received at the soup kitchen. If you get anything for free as promotion, or gift. that would all have to be declared as income. Which is on one level ludicrous. (even more absurdly: Technically if you get a tax deduction, it would have to be counted as taxable income, which is the outcome of taxing things you DIDN\'T earn.....). It creates a giant question mark in terms of ""perks of a job"". What kind of benefits to you by having a certain job should be quantified and taxed? How about a company car? Do you have to declare that? Do you apply ""common leasing rates""?\n\n**The justification**: You can\'t just remove ANY gift from taxation, because it allows for massive tax evasion. There is a difference for the system whether you get peanuts as wages but board and food as ""gift"", or getting a proper wage that gets taxed and have to PAY for accommodation and for your food (each being taxed as income for the provider)\n\nIn this case the universities basically are skirting their dues by artificially reducing their revenue (tuition fees not taken in) but compensating it with lower wages, thus reducing the payroll tax on the students side.\n\n**The flaw**:\nTHe flaw is that this AGAIN is  putting the pressure on the weakest people IN this situation, by now taxing the forgiven tuition as income, as IF they had received it as income and then paid it, thus making receiving the waiver unattractive, thus forcing the students to demand wages that allows them to PAY the tuition, which then gets taxed as revenue on the universities side.  \nedit: Additional flaw: It doesn\'t work. The workaround for the university is to increase the wages by JUST the amount the students have to pay as taxes, this STILL doesn\'t force them to pay taxes on their forgiven revenue (basically implying that universities are lobbying hard enough to skirt THAT part of the problem)\n\n**Solution**: If the goal is to prevent universities to apply this trick, but not want to punish the students, the tuition would have to be tax deductible. Basically the whole problem only arises because of for-profit education to begin with.\n\n**Additional observation**:\nThe above is independent from observations or disagreement of how the actual tax burden is distributed in the US. It doesn\'t address how the worst offenders against the common good get the most lenient tax deductions and lowest taxes, or why specifically for profit education is under the microscope here, rather than other ways to avoid contributing to society.\n\n**Tl;dr** :\n\nJust calling it a 300% increase is dishonest and misses the issue in an effort to foster outrage.', 'Welcome to r/science!

The findings were published in the journal [Economic Letters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517652200283X).\n\nA large body of research suggests that physical appearance has an impact on a person‚Äôs success. For example, attractive people tend to earn more money and report higher life satisfaction than less attractive people. Interestingly, scholars have yet to agree on the explanation behind this beauty premium.\n\nOne account suggests that the beauty advantage can be explained by discrimination. For example, employers may inherently favor attractive over unattractive workers. Another perspective suggests that beauty is a productivity-enhancing attribute. This view suggests that attractiveness lends itself to higher productivity, for example, through increased self-confidence.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in discrimination generally,‚Äù said Adrian Mehic, a graduate student at Lund University and the author of the new study. ‚ÄúIn economics research, lots of attention is given to discrimination based on gender and/or race. While these are important issues, there has not been much research on beauty-based discrimination in the educational setting, so the paper fills a gap there.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlso, the pandemic made discrimination based on appearance much more difficult, since teachers could not readily see students‚Äô faces. Whereas discrimination on for instance gender is possible in the online setting also, as long as you have the names of students.‚Äù', 'I wonder if unattractive people did any better?', 'This study has cause quite the stir here in Sweden, especially at Lunds University. And there are many reasons why that is. Of course with a headline like that it is going to attract readers from both within and outside academia, and some of the readers wont be able to tell if the research has been done properly or not. \nAdrian Mehic is now under investigation from the National Research Ethics Board for not conducting ethical research.\n\n The most disturbing part is that it was conducted without the subjects knowing they were part of the study, and therefore without their consent. Big no no. \nFuthermore the level of attractivness was decided by him going through the subjects social media and picking out what ge thougt were the most attractive pictures of them. These pictures were then sent to a ""jury"" consisting of about 70 persons, of which about half were high schoolers (!) to rate their attractiveness. As mention, all of this were done without their knowledge and is as a whole pretty skewed way to rate attractiveness. \n\nIn his ""study"" he also dosnt mention that the absolut main part (in general 70-90%) of the students grades are decided by their final exams, which are only identified by their student IDs. The teacher grading never know which test belongs to which student and at lunds University they are in general not present at the final exams, except for like 10-15 min to answer a question or two. \n\nObligatory Sorry for bad formatting and english, im writing from my phone in the bath.', ""This study is being criticized in Sweden due to the fact they had to determine and rate people's beauty and mostly because the scoring of participants leaked"", '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', 'Very interesting that it disappeared for female students but not male students.

Attractiveness gives way to what\'s known as the ""halo effect"" , that a bias in the person perceiving the attractiveness begins to associate a whole wealth of positive traits to that person. The attractive person could be average in intelligence, but the halo effect would make someone think that because they\'re beautiful they must also be smart, confident, kind, compassionate, a good mother/father, good at business, etc etc.\n\nThere\'s already a bias in the workplace where once women have children, career advancement and pay tends to come to a halt compared to single women, whereas men who father children tend to see gains in pay and career advancement compared to their single counterparts. I\'ve always wondered if that played into the halo effect as well (e.g. a male supervisor looking to sexualize an employee but holds off on women he views as other men\'s property or ruined by motherhood vs men needing to be breadwinners to provide for his wife and children.)\n\nThe halo effect causes massive disparities in pay even without counting for racial/gender disparities. Attractive people are seen to make up to 20% more than unattractive people. Being overweight or obese alone can add an additional 5-10% reduction in pay.\n\nMind you, I graduated high school in \'07 and college in \'12, So I feel like we\'ve made strides in terms of social tolerance and acceptance.

Commercial HVAC systems have dedicated units in the right places for this sterilization. \n\n* UV light in the AC system will impact some virus that circulates through the system, but only if it is slow moving air to give it enough time to be exposed to UV-C light, and it does nothing to the air a sick person just spread around the room before it cycles via your AC.

Most settings you would use this for (say a section of a mall or hospital) would be moving (rough approximation) at least 10,000CFM (cubic feet per minute) across the unit coil or main ducts. Air volumes this large would expect the air to be moving up to 2000 feet per minute through the system (assuming VAV system. it may be a constant volume rooftop system that would have slightly lower air velocity, but still wouldn‚Äôt work for more reasons). So simple math- 2,000 FPM, needs 30 seconds of exposure, that leads to a 1,000ft run of UV light to reach that 99%. Yes, maybe shorter exposure time will still lead to at least some neutralization, but the lengths of light required would still be massive and probably beyond the length of the longest main duct runs of most systems. \n\nThis doesn‚Äôt even take into account that hospitals require their HVAC systems to be 100% outside air (aka all air entering the AHU is from the outside, and all the air in the hospital gets exhausted back to the outside). (EDIT: as pointed out, this last sentence was not entirely true, there is some recirculation of air in certain rooms in hospitals. I‚Äôd still categorize a hospital in the same category as my next sentence however) Mass gathering areas in general (like a mall), require a significant percentage of fresh outside air as well.\n\nEdit: and for in home applications, typically the air is moving in the 500-1000FPM range.

As you can see, the summer pole receives about as much sunlight as the equator (actually, slightly more because of the 24-hour days in the arctic circle!).  On the other hand, there\'s a huge difference in energy provided to the equator vs the completely dark winter pole.   As a result, there\'s a huge difference in temperature between the winter pole and the equator, and not so much between the summer pole and equator.\n\nBut that just explains changes in temperature vs *latitude*, not changes over time, so let\'s think about weather systems.  Storms are created by the north-south temperature gradient: as heat moves from equator to pole, a small amount of it is converted into kinetic energy.  Heat flow causes motion, just like a very inefficient steam or gasoline engine.  When the temperature difference is large, the ""engine"" runs faster and more efficiently, creating more kinetic energy -- which is to say the storm winds blow stronger when the pole-equator temperature difference is large.\n\nSo.  In the wintertime, the difference in solar heating creates a much larger equator-pole temperature difference than in the summer.  This creates much stronger wind patterns.  So you\'ve got stronger winds, blowing a bigger temperature gradient around across the surface of the Earth ... so you see much bigger temperature shifts from day to day.\n\nEdited to add some examples.

But I'll put some basic points below:\n\nFirs, it's hard to quantify something that is kind of abstract like the phenomenon you describe, but it does have a basis in truth. [Using Chicago as an example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Chicago#Data): In January, the average temperature (not the average high or low, the average overall temperature) is 20.8F (-6.2C). The record high in January is 67F (19C) and the record low is -33F (-36C). That's a departure of +46F and -54F between the average temperature and the record highs and lows. In contrast: in July the average temperature is 71.7F (22.1C). The record July high is 111F (44C) and the record low is 40F (4C). That's a similar departure for the record high (+39F) but a much lower departure for the record low (-32F).\n\nSo what is the cause of this discrepancy? This is due to many factors, most of which are hard to explain at anything less than a college level, but I will aim for high-school level and see how I do.\n\n\n**1. Thermal radiation**\n\nThe major contributing cause has to do with the different phenomena that cause air to cool down vs warm up. Ignoring small effects, air cools down almost solely due to [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation) escaping into space. Thermal radiation is a very important phenomenon that is sadly misunderstood by many (because it is often poorly explained, even by physics teachers!), but in a nutshell, all matter, everywhere in the universe, emits [electromagnetic radiation](https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html), and the amount of energy it releases via this radiation goes up as the temperature goes up, and down as the temperature goes down. The earth and air are no exception, they are both constantly releasing thermal radiation, and without external sources of heat they would be constantly cooling off.\n\nIgnoring effects from clouds and the atmosphere absorbing and re-emitting the thermal radiation (these effects are not negligible, but not important to this explanation) it gets cooler at night because the ground and air are emitting thermal radiation out to space. This is a slow process, that is made even slower by the fact that as it cools down, it emits less energetic thermal radiation, so the rate of cooling slows down as the temperature drops.\n\nThis is all in contrast to the way the earth heats up: via light from the sun. Sunlight is (roughly) constant and [very energetic compared to the weak infrared radiation released by the earth and its air](http://faculty.icc.edu/easc111lab/labs/labi/waveradi.jpg). Even a very small amount of sun is enough to offset the cooling by earth's thermal radiation, so in the summer, with long sunny days and short nights, there just isn't much time for the temperatures to drop significantly.\n\n**2. Polar day vs. polar night (summer vs. winter)**\n\n*Note that the following explanation is specific to the [mid-latitudes](http://isen.northwestern.edu/sites/default/files/images/articles/2016/oct/Horton_globe_widgetLARGE2.png), which are areas which are not in the tropics and not near the north or south pole. It is also northern-hemisphere-specific, you need to flip the directions if you're in the southern hemisphere.*\n\nGoing along with the above point, it's worth pointing out that, when it's very cold out, the air that you're feeling didn't get that way just because of nighttime cooling: it's almost always because that air came from a much colder region. Cool/cold snaps, both in winter and summer, result from winds blowing from the north. Likewise, heat waves are usually due to air which originated further south, just because areas further south have the sun closer to overhead, and so the [solar heating is stronger](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/irradiance1.jpg).\n\nIn the winter, the polar regions are in a constant night, meaning that unless warmer air is pushed up from the south, the air will just continually get colder, and colder. So even though radiational cooling as explained above gets slower and slower as you get colder, this can result in **very** cold temperatures over the course of weeks and months of constant night! \n\nOn the other hand, in the summer, the northern arctic is in constant daylight. The sun is at a low angle for sure, but even this feeble heating influence is enough to counteract most of the cooling due to thermal radiation, and it means that any air pushing south to create a cold snap will start at a much higher temperature, and even if it doesn't warm up at all as it moves south (in reality it will be warming up at least a little) it just won't be the extreme, below-zero cold that is possible in the winter.\n\n**3. Humidity's restriction on cooling air**\n\nThe existence of water vapor means that heating-vs-cooling is not an even process: for all intents and purposes, you can heat air indefinitely without hitting any barriers, but if you cool off air that has some water vapor in it, eventually you will reach the dew point: the temperature at which the humidity is 100%. When you cool down to that temperature, water vapor will start to condense into a liquid (or solid), which is an exothermic (heat-releasing) process. This means that any further cooling will be much slower, because of this extra energy that is constantly being released by the condensing water.\n\nBecause average temperatures are higher in the summer, average humidities are also higher (outside of desert areas that have very little liquid water available to evaporate). This means that it is very hard to get the right circumstances in the summer to get very cold temperatures.\n\n**tl;dr: Unfortunately I really don't have one. It's a complicated subject with complicated causes. I tried to keep the above as simple as possible, go ahead and give it a try!**\n\nWell, this answer got way longer than I thought it would, and it doesn't even really come close to the full explanation I wish I could type up. But let me know if you have any follow-up questions, and I'll try to clarify things as much as possible!"", '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', ""2 basic reasons.\n\n\nTL:DR\n1.  Artic air is colder in the winter than it is in the summer so you don't get real cold swings in summer, Tropical air masses are basically the same temperature in winter and summer, so if it does make it to the Midwest in winter it will still be warm leading to a larger temperature swing.\n2.  The Jetstream is stronger and closer to the Midwest in the winter.\n\n\n1.  The area around the north pole goes through temperature changes.  In the winter it is really cold(about -30F), so when that cold air gets pulled down into the Midwest it is really cold and we get to deal with all the wonderful things that cold weather brings.  In the summer that artic air is much warmer(37-54F).  So even if you get air coming south from the artic in summer it is not as cold to begin with and with much more energy being added along the way by the sun in summer it will not be nearly as cold as it is in the winter when it arrives.  Now for the opposite.  The temperature in the tropics is almost constant.  So no matter what time of year it is the same temperature air will be coming up.  So in winter, that tropical air is the same temperature as it is in summer and we notice a spring like warmup in the Midwest.\n2.  The jet stream position is such that it is just south of the Midwest in winter but still close enough that a small shift can bring up warm air.  In the summer the jet stream is much farther North meaning a large shift, much larger than in winter would need to occur to pull artic air down to the Midwest.  Add to this that it is weaker in the summer and stronger in the winter and you are more likely to get large temperature swings in winter than you are in the summer."", ""[Chinook wind](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_wind) is one cause of the warm air during winter.

In my physics class we talked about lightning rods; before electricity was well understood people tried to guide lightning away from buildings with roof-mounted conductive orbs. The orbs actually had higher capacitance with the clouds than the ground does, meaning that the orbs would simply cause larger arcs of lightning to hit them/the building than if there was no orb at all. A lightning rod has a very low capacitance with the sky and can also slowly dissipate charge from the clouds, resulting in less powerful/damaging lightning in the area near the rod. So while giraffes are tall, the shape of their heads and bodies might also impact their odds of getting hit in the same manner shape impacts lightning rods/orbs (although this may be wrong since the giraffe is a poor conductor compared to something like a lightning rod, and this may reduce or prevent charge dissipation)."", 'You also have to consider the frequency of lightning in certain places.

The slotted head screws are cheap and easy to make. But they're completely useless for powered screwdrivers and you can't put much torque on the screw without it either slipping out or stripping the head (and maring the surface of whatever you're screwing). Phillips screws are self-centering, making powered screwdrivers possible. They're somewhat more expensive to produce than slotted-head. They tend to 'cam-out' easily under torque, making it hard to apply much torque. I've heard they were designed that way to prevent overtightning. However, it's not good for exposed fasteners to look stripped. Robertson-head and allen-head fasteners can handle more torque than phillips-head fasteners, but are more expensive. Because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out. The robertson-head is cheaper than the allen-head, but the allen-head has six points of contact rather than 4, making it less prone to rounding out the hole. The Torx-head fasteners solve the problem of rounding/stripping by having the flat bottom of the robertson/allen that reduces cam-out, but it has much better contact with the driving bit to prevent stripping the head. The points of the 'star' on the driving bit engage the recesses on the screw at nearly right angles, so it has a very positive contact. Torx is becoming more and more popular because of that, particularly in assembly-line work. Because they're less likely than a phillips to be damaged when tightening, the allen (internal hex) heads are often used for exposed ('decorative') fasteners on 'some assembly required' furniture. It's also very cheap to make the allen keys, so they usually include one with the fasteners.\n"", ""You've got some good answers here already, but they're all leaving out an important aspect, which is how the screw and screwdriver deal with fouling. Dirt, oil, weld slag, multiple layers of paint, whatever. If you're in an environment where you don't have to worry about that, a complex geometry is fine. But on a factory floor, Phillips or torx can get irreversibly fouled. Allen head screws can be relatively easily cleaned, but the master of this is the shittiest of all screw heads, the flat head. The *only* tool you need to clear the slot of a flat head screw is the screwdriver you're going to use to unscrew it.

Other screws we don't want them messing with and may use Torx or something more rare.\n\nIn fact some companies specialize in making strange screw head shapes purely for security reasons, [as seen in this chart.](http://cdn.clm02.com/ezvivi.com/204050/6359362590222142198612765.jpg)"", 'To add, universal standards are a hard thing to decide upon.

She told him to move to specific areas under the bribe that if he does, he will find treats. But he didn‚Äôt consistently move to those spots and has yet to find the treats, etc. \n\nThe night before the family meeting, the last experiment she did was to put scissors over Squint‚Äôs legs and close them ever so slightly to see how Squint would respond, stopping just short of actually cutting Squint‚Äôs legs. She said that any living thing would not have trusted her to stop and would have moved away or fought back and therefore, he‚Äôs not real.\n\nAdmittedly I was a bit disturbed, but we had a big talk away from her little brother and asked her to please not spoil the magic for him, which she promised not to do.', 'HUGE Thank you to /u/folkingawesome who generously turned my 3:07 video into this long-ass GIF.', 'That would receive my vote as GIF of the year', 'Is it strange I can hear this gif?

It was avant garde, just like he wanted to be. The man, as he was so, just wanted a place in this world for his art.

""Are you yet another man come to end my life, if you can even see it that way?"" The hand didn\'t answer, as it had no mouth.

He paused for a minute, still as a statue, then knocked once again. The rain fell outside in a steady rhythm, and by this time the man‚Äôs shoes had become damp. A minute passed, then another. The man crouched under the awning and pulled his bag to safety. It had begun to leak an ocean of colors. Red and blue mixed with green, as a wave a rainwater swept it down the muddy steps. \n\nThe door creaked open and a suspicious face peeked through the crack. ‚ÄúHallo, was willst do?‚Äù The man behind the door inquired. The man on the other side cocked his head and put his hand do his ear. Almost invisible with the naked eye, a small earpiece was nestled firmly in his ear. It whirred to life. ‚ÄúHello, what do you want?‚Äù The earpiece repeated. \n\n‚ÄúHello, my name is Bob Ross. If you have a moment, I‚Äôd like to teach you about the joys of painting.‚Äù The man‚Äôs voice outside was soothing, and as soon as he had finished his sentence a small device in his hand translated it for his company. \n\n‚ÄúMind if I come in?‚Äù\n\nWith that, Bob shouldered his way inside. With a gentle dominance, he lay his bag on the table and began unpacking.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you doing? What is this?‚Äù The owner of the house backed away from the table, and it was clear he grew increasingly uneasy.\n\n‚ÄúI just want to show you the joy of painting.‚Äù Bob continued, as he took a canvas out of his bag. ‚ÄúJust give me a chance.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy are you doing this? Get out of my house.""\n\nBob ignored the request; ‚ÄúI just like to spread joy.‚Äù With that, a genuine smile crept across Bob‚Äôs face, and he drew back his hood to reveal a bushy afro underneath. ‚ÄúPlease my friend, take a seat.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúHitler.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease, Hitler, take a seat.‚Äù\n\nHitler reclined warily onto his sofa while Bob set up the canvas across from him. \n\n‚ÄúNow, what I like to paint most is the beauty of nature. There‚Äôs just something so magical about our world. First, I want to get a nice blue for the sky, and some dark hues for the ground. Let‚Äôs make it a nice summer scene in contrast to all this dreariness.‚Äù\n\nBob continued with his presentation, explaining each technique and stroke. Hitler grew more and more interested, and eventually rose to inspect the painting.\n \n‚ÄúWhy do you do such thin strokes of the brush? I would think a more decisive movement would be key.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, Hitler, sometimes the best art comes from gentleness and patience.‚Äù Bob‚Äôs soothing voice answered. \n\nBob finished his painting; it had been nearly three hours. He usually worked at a faster rate, but this was one painting that couldn‚Äôt afford any mistakes. ‚ÄúSo Hitler, what do you think. Want to take a turn?‚Äù\n\nHitler shifted, and the creak of the floorboards beneath his boots was the only sound. He wordlessly swept his hands around the paintings frames and touched its surface with the utmost care. \n\n‚ÄúWhy is it you paint, Bob?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I love to do.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI feel the same, yet I have never produced a piece such as this.""

""I\'m not..."" He stopped, and put his hand to his mustache. \n\nBob reached for his coat, and fingered a sleek metal object. There was only one thing to do if Hitler said no.\n', 'In the December dusk, the bubbles of light around the street lamps, whirling with specks of sparkling ice crystals, looked like oversized snow globes.\n\n‚ÄúI want to capture the street outside,‚Äù Adolf said.  ‚ÄúWhere do I start? Atmosphere? Lighting? A blitz of color?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou start by not painting,‚Äù Bob said. ‚ÄúFirst you need to understand. You start by thinking.‚Äù\n\nThe young aspiring artist flipped his hair to the side, narrowing his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúCareful deliberation is the key to a great painting,‚Äù Bob continued. ‚ÄúRemember; every stroke of the brush has consequences.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo, I start simple?‚Äù Adolf said. ‚ÄúThe falling snow!‚Äù\n\nBob ran a hand through his thick hair and took a deep breath.\n\n‚ÄúThat is a good place to start. A snowflake is one of Nature‚Äôs most beautiful creations,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all made out of the same water, but every snowflake is unique‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think I get it now,‚Äù Adolf said and made a few quick strokes across the canvas. ‚ÄúThe canvas is the province of my expression. It is a domain that I, alone, control and shape to fit my unique ideas.‚Äù\n\nBob shook his head and stopped the eager hand of the young artist.\n\n‚ÄúYour brush is a coryph√©e, and the canvas is a stage of white ice. The stage belongs to the art, not the artist,‚Äù Bob said.\n\n‚ÄúSo, I need to pour my mind onto the canvas,‚Äù Adolf said and made another series of quick strokes. ‚ÄúI need to get it all out, and not consider my desires!‚Äù\n\nBob leaned over and plucked the brush out of young man‚Äôs moving hand mid-motion. \n\n‚ÄúWrong; your heart is your most valuable consultant,‚Äù Bob said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt rush. Some ideas are better left unexplored. Each color and stroke have to feel right in your heart. If your strokes are too fast and too many, your heart won‚Äôt be able to keep up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think I finally get it‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nCertain that he had taught Adolf the value of constraint and diversity, Bob Ross returned to his own time. On the way to the kitchen to grab a snack, he noticed that something was wrong with his world globe. The place that had previously said Europe now had big capital letters spelling GERMANY.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù Bob mumbled and grabbed his history book.\n\n*Due to his icy restraint and meticulous planning, Hitler avoided a war on two fronts, taking his time to first defeat France and Great Britain before attacking Russia. Modern scholars have placed Hitler among iconic conquerors such as Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan, and named him The Artist of Warfare.*\n\n*****\n[/r/Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lilwa_Dexel/comments/5foev0/welcome/)', ""\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: All top-level comments must be a story or poem.

He remembered and replied almost robotically.\n\nBob nodded, with his strange hair gently shaking. His brush working a nearby canvas as he hummed a wordless tune.\n\nHitler could only stare at this oddity of a man and wonder *\'How does he stay so positive?!\'*\n\nHe wanted to know more about America, the country this man belonged to, but he always shrugged off any specific questions.\n\nThe only thing Bob acknowledged was that previous attempts on Adolph\'s life were from people of his time and some set in Bob\'s future. Yet here this stranger stood, painting as if he was in his own studio.\n\nDespite his attempts to apply for the Academy, Hitler was turned down every moment. His personal life was taking a turn for the worse as well.\nMore and more he was frustrated, angry, unhappy, and needed to vent somewhere. He found that place in the happy settings that he and Bob created.\n\nWonderful trees, beautiful skies, a utopia, and one Adolph wished would be so in reality.\nThen one day, Bob was not at the easel. He stared at a nearby window looking at the populace below.\n""I didn\'t care much to draw people."" Bob broke the silence. \n\nAdolph was slightly shocked by this admission of professional weakness. Bob never admitted to anything limiting himself or Adolph, always encouraging that anything is possible. Adolph wondered if this was a test, ""Yes they do require some extra skill compared to a happy little tree."" He tried to smile as he replied.\n\nBob turned to look Adolph in the eyes; warm but still distant, as though looking at something millions of miles away.\n""Capturing the esscence of people is hard to do on paint. What matters is capturing the imagination of people as they look at your pantings *right there*."" The man\'s gaze returned back to Adolph, taking his shoulder and guiding the young German to another room.\n\nIt was filled with all of Adolph\'s past pantings, ones he thought he threw away. He gave Bob an incredulous look, ""I threw these away! They are garbage! They are mis--""\n\nBob cut him off, ""They are happy accidents. Merely pantings you haven\'t finished because you gave up on them. Just like how so many give up on lots of things and others.""\n\nGrabbing Adolph rather roughly, he spun the man to face his previous discards. ""You left every one of these? Why?"" Pointing to a random picture, ""Because it was after your rejection letter?"" Then another, ""Because that one girl you like didn\'t reciprocate?"" Another off in the corner, ""Because you were so caught up in the details you didn\'t remember the heart of your creation?!""\n\nAt this point Adolph\'s anger boiled, ""YES YES and YES! All of them are failures. The Academy wouldn\'t take suchs sloppy details! **I AM A FAILURE!**"" Tears almost forming in the corners of his eyes.\n\nBob released his shoulders, the calm voice returning, ""So who are you painting for? Them or you? Each of these paintings deserve a chance to be finished. That\'s art, that\'s what is missing, and that\'s why I want you to finish them.""\n\nSo the weeks went, Adolph Hitler consulted Bob Ross on every ""mistake"" he wanted to discard. Bob would offer advice on what could be used to improve upon the paintings. As they worked together, Adolph lost his resentment to society little by little and replaced it with his own pride on the art.\n\nIt was later when Bob announced a public display at a nearby park, featuring Hitler\'s works. The presentation wasn\'t to the art critics, the Academy, or anyone of high importance to society. It was to the common man and woman. The beggars, the old, the Jews and the Gentiles alike. Some found his art interesting, some disagreed, others found it boring, but those that stayed grouped around him to ask about his styles. With each presentation, the small groups grew.\n\nBob tried to show Adolph Hitler that every man, woman, and child deserves to see art. It wasn\'t reserved for anyone special. It was there for everyone to touch their hearts. As a result of these presentations he made waves, for good and ill, in the art world. Slowly Adolph was displaying his art in public or even painting on the sides of buildings in secret. All of this to show his audience, his *people*, that they had the power to choose what art was instead of the academies.\n\nBob eventually returned to his own time, hoping that the swell of the audience would give Adolph the love he apparently didn\'t get in his life. As Bob noted subtle changes to the ""present"" he noticed that WW2 sadly still occured, but under different circumstances.\n\nResearching Hitler\'s life, he found that the young man was killed in WW1 by a jealous French prostitute. Apparently she was enamored by his successes and grew frantic in her obsession. This young Jewish girl killed him and herself in a misguided attempt to ""be together forever"".\n\nBob Ross was taken aback by the news, or rather history, and looked at the masses of people in the library.\nConflicted in his feelings. He prevented WW2 as he knew it, but at the cost of a young man and woman. \nCountless lives changed forever. \n""I didn\'t care much to draw people."" Bob broke the silence to himself, ""People are too chaotic to figure out.""', '[deleted]', 'Adolf woke. \n\nHe wasn‚Äôt sure what had awakened him, but he found himself staring at the shadowy ceiling of his tiny flat just the same.  It was quiet ‚Äì so quiet that he was sure neither dawn nor dusk were anywhere close at hand ‚Äì and yet, still he was awake. More awake, in fact, than he had felt in years. He shivered beneath his blanket despite the warmth, and lit a candle. \n\n‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù He asked the darkness. It felt right, he thought, to speak like this into the night. He could feel eyes on him, even if he wasn‚Äôt sure anyone was really there. If he was wrong, no one would be the wiser. But if he was right‚Ä¶\n\nHitler gasped as a hooded figure rose from the darkness at the foot of his bed, growing like a shadow at dusk. He clutched the covers closer to his chest. \n\n‚ÄúWhat are you!?‚Äù He exclaimed. ‚ÄúSome specter? Are you some devil, come to steal the breath from my lungs and soul from my flesh? Show yourself!‚Äù \n\nTo his surprise, the figure stopped, holding up a finger as if to ask for a moment while he fumbled with his hood. It seemed to bulge oddly, as if it were caught on something, but eventually he pulled it free. \n\nIt was simply a man.\n\n‚ÄúSorry. Must have‚Ä¶slipped? Never did like these cloaks.‚Äù The figure said in halting German. He flashed Adolf a sheepish smile, and despite himself the pajama-clad man felt himself begin to smile as well. There was something about him, about the way he looked just a bit embarrassed beneath his disheveled bush of hair that was endearing. Despite that, however, he wasn‚Äôt ready to relax just yet. \n\n‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶who are you? Why have you come here into my bedchambers so rudely, and without invitation?‚Äù Adolf asked. \n\nAgain, the man smiled. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm anyone that special.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúJust a‚Ä¶teacher? Is that the word? I work with paint, and I thought‚Ä¶you might enjoy getting to paint, a bit.‚Äù \n\nHitler blinked. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶well, yes. I consider myself quite the expert, if I do say so. But why have you come? Are you from the school? You are no one I recognize.‚Äù He looked the man up and down, and was struck by how odd he looked with his black cloak and his fuzzy head. It reminded him of something, though he couldn‚Äôt quite put a finger on what it was.\n\n‚ÄúWell, no, not from the school exactly.‚Äù The strange man said. ‚ÄúI am‚Ä¶from far away? The others, they have‚Ä¶sealed this time off, yes? So no one else can come. You are rather unpopular, where I come from. Many have sought your life, though we have stopped them all‚Ä¶will have stopped them? You even stopped a few yourself, I think.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúStopped? My life?‚Äù Adolf asked, frowning. ‚ÄúI have no recollection of this. Why do they seek to kill me? I have done no wrong to warrant it, at least in memory.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, well‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all a bit complicated. Harder, too, in German. I cannot explain. Regardless, I was sent here as‚Ä¶an apology. For things that haven‚Äôt, and will never happen. For my rudeness, I also apologize. Now was the only time I could come. It was the earliest we could reach before they started coming. Now, I must ask again‚Ä¶would you paint with me?‚Äù \n\n‚Äú*Pinsel!*‚Äù Hitler exclaimed. ‚Äú*Ein pinsel*! I knew you looked like something! Yes, Mr. Pinsel, I will paint with you. If only because this is clearly a dream, and I have quite the love of painting.‚Äù \n\nThe man smiled. From somewhere within his cloak ‚Äì where, Hitler couldn‚Äôt imagine, as it was rather tight‚Äì he withdrew a pair of easels, complete with canvas, paint, and brushes. \n\n‚ÄúVery well!‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúLet us paint!‚Äù \n\nAnd so they did. \n\nThe hours fled before their strokes, each of them trying to outdo the other in painting after painting. Hitler was surprised ‚Äì though this man was clearly not German, he was still very, very good. Better, indeed, than Hitler himself, though he didn‚Äôt want to admit it. But never once did he flaunt his superiority. Indeed, he made fun of his own imperfections, laughing and turning them into a beauty the likes of which Hitler had to admire. ‚ÄúThere are no mistakes.‚Äù He explained. ‚ÄúMerely‚Ä¶accidents. Happy accidents.‚Äù \n\nThe man, too, was surprised at Adolf. In the history books, all they ever spoke of was the hatred, the atrocities. The monster. Instead, what he found before him was a man. A man like himself, filled with laughter and art and pain and joy and sorrow. Perhaps that was even more frightening than the beast. \n\nBut soon, the sky outside the window turned from black to gray, and the candle burned low in its stand. \n\n‚ÄúAlas, Adolf, our time grows short.‚Äù The man said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I will need to be leaving soon.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúAh! You speak truth, Mr. Pinsel. I forgot the hour! Though I am still not sure whether you were real or not, our time together was quite enjoyable. I hope that you come to visit again. Perhaps there is a thing or two I could learn.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYes. I think‚Ä¶I think that would be nice.‚Äù The cloaked man said, smiling sadly. ‚ÄúGoodbye, Adolf. Good luck with your painting. I hope it brings you much joy, even when times are bleakest.‚Äù He offered a hand.\n\n‚ÄúAnd you as well, my friend.‚Äù Adolf replied. He grasped his hand, and was shocked to find a needle in his palm. At once, Hitler began to fall, only to be caught and dropped gently into bed by the cloaked stranger. \n\nThe man shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can call the mistakes you are going to make happy, Adolf, but you deserve the chance to make them. That‚Äôs only right.‚Äù \n\nWith a whirl of his cloak, Mr. Pinsel was gone, leaving nothing behind but a single canvas and a few drops of paint on the future tyrant‚Äôs bedclothes. \n', 'The paint ran down the canvas, slowly trailing through the empty blank sheet as a deep sigh escaped my mouth. My lip quivered as I stood silently alone my modest and small room. I had been up for 3 days and the stench of stale coffee, dirty pastille paints and unlaundered clothes filled the room. A little tap echoed from the door. Who the hell could that be? It\'s 3 in the morning and I\'m certainly not expecting anyone right now, I furiously marched over and slam the door open. Strangely enough I\'m was greeted by a kind old man in a dark robe. He was holding a painting case and a blank canvas. He smiled and I was immediately disarmed and comforted by the warmness from it. I shyly motioned for him to come in.\n\nDressed in simple buttoned up shirt and blue american style jeans, I was immediately cautious but something about him seems gentle and kind. Such strange hair, it was big and bushy and unkempt, I found myself starring at it for a fraction too long. ""Hello, I\'m Bob"", his German was broken but his greeting is earnest and I shook his hand. Before I could respond he looked around the room and said ""So you paint, well glad I got here because you look like you could use a Friend.""\n\nThe room was a mess, half eaten food and cold cups of coffee litter the shelves and table space. The floor was covered in ripped up attempts at \'Art\' and pictures of her were scattered over my bed, where I had left them 3 days ago. I didn\'t go to that side of the room, I was scared to close my eyes. All I can see was her face. ""Girl troubles huh?"" I angrily flare my glaze at him when I realise he had already set up his canvas next to mine and had begun painting.\n\nHe started off with a simple dark shade of green as he made long strokes of his brush and freely splashed it across the canvas. Adding dabs of white to lighten the green as he worked his way up the canvas. He motioned me over when he handed me my brush, still wet with paint. I picked up a new canvas but Bob held my hand and said softly, ""It\'s fine, just finish what you started."" I shake my head, the mess off colour I had left on it one has dried and now it\'s a swirling mess of red, orange and brown. I was pretty angry when I had started. ""There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents."" Something about his words comforted me. Bob continued talk as I notice that the dark shade of green is starting to resemble a meadow in the country at night as Bob uses a deep purple as the Sky while he decorates it with clouds and mountains in the foreground.\n\n""You know, when I\'m feeling down in the dumps and I have no one to talk to I like to paint little friends. See this cloud here, he\'s my friend, he\'s just floating around looking over his little friends"" Bob began to spot the grass with white globs of paint, they start taking the shape of grazing sheep in the cool midnight field. I redirected my focus to my canvas filled with such angry colours in such deep contrast to his peaceful work. ""Remember, no mistakes, just happy accidents.""\n\nWe painted for hours and Bob kept talking... I said nothing for a long time but he would just smile and reassure me as I worked on my piece. I had pictured a Sunday morning in the country with my father as he would take me up a dusty trail up a hill near our house to over look our small town. So I painted a man standing on a mountain over looking a city at Sunrise. While I worked and Bob talked I would notice small things he would do like add small details to everything on the canvas, like he was slowly telling a story piece by piece.\n\nI could tell he loved art, he kept encouraging me and telling me small tricks to make all the houses and trees and clouds pop and stand out while I slowly pieced together a new happy story I had made come to life from the ghost of a forgotten memory. I kept painting and working on the small things that I thought needed fixing, a little dab of blue here and a smear of yellow here as I added an ocean and a dazzling aura of sunlight illuminating the world I had created.\n\nAnd then finally it was done, a man standing atop a mountain looking over the land he loves. I felt pride, I felt calm, I felt the sunshine through the window and the cold breeze of the door open behind me. And on my bed laid a gorgeous painting of a Shepard sleeping in a field amongst his herd under a beautiful starry night. Next to it was a note that just read.\n\n""Forgive yourself and forgive her, your friend - Bob""\n\nHe had picked up the scattered pictures and placed them on the table but left one of us smiling and holding hands. I walked over to my painting and began outlining a second figure.', 'Hitler paused, he had never seen an afro before.  There\'s an obscure law of physics where having a \'fro causes your DNA to stretch during time travel resulting in random face twitches that occur long after you return home and sometimes immediate death can occur by your lungs freezing up and you stop breathing.  Time itself seems to transform again in these agonizing final minutes of desperately wanting air but your lungs won\'t move.  The condition is known as Twice the Time Travel or what scientists call TTTT (mathematicians and lazy people simply say quad T).  Ever since time travel became mainstream every scientist from every era has made it their quest to make the connection between afros and this tragic disease, the only known side effect of time travel.  Some of the best minds from the future, the ones who cured cancer and created the machines to turn salt water into fresh water have tackled this science mystery but there has been no other solution but to simply get rid of the beautiful \'fro.  Even the best of the time traveling assassins from the various eras of the afro don\'t like to risk it and thus they always cut their hair. But not Bob.  Bob wasn\'t afraid of time travel, or possible excruciating death or Hitler.  He had made the journey, he was on the other side, he was in front of Hitler in every ounce of his Bob Ross glory, unchanged.  Bob locked eye contact with Hitler, who was staring.  Bob said nothing.  His left eyebrow started to twitch.  \n\nHitler didn\'t notice the eyebrow twitch.  He was absorbed in his own head, thinking about his mustache and how it didn\'t hold a candle in the wind to this stranger\'s hair.  How could he get his own hair to do the same? Women had always eluded Hitler.  He felt if he could learn how to do his hair like this man\'s he could have any woman he wanted.  Maybe he could even take over the world.  Bob holds out a fistful of paintbrushes and some paint.  ""I know you don\'t know me, but I know you"" Bob stated.  ""I\'ve come to help teach you to paint all your dreams on a canvas"".  \n\n""Nevermind that"" Hitler replied, gazing beyond the paint brushes, paint, and above the man\'s twitching eyebrow.  His eyes fixed on the hair.  ""I want to ask YOU about something""....', 'When, Bob Ross was sent to 1910, his mission was clear - help Hitler become a painter. After 3 months of long painting sessions, Adolf was becoming a really good artist. If it continued like that, Bob would be successful, WW2 would never happen. \n\nOne day, as Bob woke up in his bed, he saw another time traveller sitting in his room. \n\n‚ÄúHi, Mr. Ross‚Äù ‚Äì said the time traveller. \n\nBob did not answer. \n\n‚ÄúI have to admit, you have been quite unexpectedly successful. Not only have you thought him how to paint, but also, it seems like you have molded Hitler into a charming fellow. You should be really proud.‚Äù \n\nBob planned to say something, but the time traveller rudely went on speaking.\n\n‚ÄúYou see, Mr. Ross we have run the simulations and it turns out we were quite, quite wrong. It is essential that WW2 happens.‚Äù \n\nBob wanted to ask why, but he was interrupted again. \n\n‚ÄúBob, if Hitler does not wrestle control of the Germany. All the scientists, who have immigrated to USA in 1933, will stay happily where they are. This means that Germans will be first to develop the nuclear bomb and that is when they start the WW2, they will also be first to develop the time travelling machine, so if we don‚Äôt fix this now we will never have the chance‚Äù.\n\nGermans ruling the world is bad thought Bob, but what could he do, Hitler was really not that bad of a human being anymore. \n\nThe time traveller continued ‚Äì ‚ÄúAs I have said earlier, you were too successful. At this point you are his only friend. So, Mr. Ross future has one more favor to ask. You need to be killed painfully in front of Adolf Hitler by the group of Jews.‚Äù \n\nBob was expecting everything, but this.   \n\n--\nFirst WP and not a native speaker so forgive me for the mistakes.', ""Sometimes I hate my job. Simply hate it. At this point I've killed 36 time travelers, they keep coming, I keep killing. I often wish I could just let them finish their job, but at what cost? This was my reward for being the best. I get to do the worst. Each traveler I've killed has had the same idea. Go back, save millions; by killing the most wretched man in history.\n\nI would do the same, in fact I did. When I first invented the means to travel in time I had a grand time, I was rich, I had everything anyone could ever want. I had seen the most amazing things, but at some point the guilt of not using my invention for something better got the best of me. I went back in time, I killed Hitler.\n\nIt was easy. I could pick any point in his life, even at the height of his power. Simply pop on by and shoot him in the head, strangle him in his sleep or the method I decided to go with: Help an assassin complete his job.\n\nIt was easy as pie. I simply gave a few tips to a man named Nikolaus von Halem about Hitlers plans the coming week and two days later a man named Beppo R√∂mer shot and killed Hitler in the autumn of 1939. I joined a celebration in London that evening and met the woman who would later become my wife.\n\nI decided to stop time traveling and settled with my wife in London where we raised a son and daughter. Tensions had been rising between the Allies and the Soviet Union during this time, but it looked to me like the inevitable Cold War was starting as before, only this time without the deaths of tens of millions of people following the Second World War.\n\nGermany was split between the east and west and I was sure that while my actions hadn't radically changed history at least I had prevented mass killings, the atomic bomb had not been used on Japan who had capitulated shortly after fall of Germany once the Allied forced had changed their focus on them.\n\nEverything was going well until one day I heard the chilling sound of air raid sirens. My wife and I rushed our family to the nearest bomb shelter, but it was too late. I was knocked unconscious and woke up to a sight I had never imagined. Dust and rubble everywhere, fires, everything was dark and gray. My children and wife were dead. A building had fallen on them.\n\nI instantly knew what had happened. I did this. I changed history and now my family was dead. I used my old invention I had swore to never again touch. I tried hundreds of ways to stop the impending disaster, but no matter what I did I could not save my family, I could not stop nuclear war. Every path, every change led to the same result. A world without Hitler it seemed was a world where no one could live.\n\nI had tried for years to find a solution when I finally made the decision to save one of the worst people in history and kill 60 million others to save the rest of humanity.\n\nI went back in time, I intervened with Beppo R√∂mers plans so he was arrested. Hitler saved and history restored. I was in my late 40ies now, at least that's what I think. It's hard to tell the passing of time when you live outside it. I couldn't go back to my old life. My wife was in her early 20ies at this point, I was twice her age.\n\nI made the decision to go back to my own time, back to before my time travel antics during the mid 21st century. A simpler more linear time. What I intended to be my travel back to my old town however turned out to be something else entirely. I was in a dead forest. I was sure I had the right coordinates, but my town simply wasn't here. I traveled back to London to see what was going on, and all I saw was again rubble and ruins. The nuclear war had happened regardless.\n\nI had done something wrong or changed something else. So I traveled back to 1945 and to my surprise Hitler had not died recently, but in a mysterious assassination plot. Perhaps this was a butterfly effect of my previous actions, something I did made history change in some minor way and an assassination was successful.\n\nI went back to a day a few hours before his death which now was in 1937. It was in the middle of the night, in his bedroom. I stayed in the corner, silent and invisible and simply watched. Then something familiar happened. A time traveler popped into view. Exactly how my invention worked. He walked over to Hitler when I told him to stop. He turned around and I shot him.\n\nI returned to 1945 to again read up on Hitlers final end. This time I couldn't even find an article about it. After a ton of research I figured out a German soldier had died in 1916 during the battle of the Somme. Somehow my time travel technology was being used by others to go back in time and kill Hitler.\n\nThis went on and on for years. Someone killed Hitler, I found out where, when and how and went back and saved him. Sometimes it was easy, sometimes it was hard. I once spent a whole year tracking him as a child when all I could find was the year of his death. Once he was slowly poisoned over a period of 3 years which was a really hard nut to crack.\n\nEventually though, all plans to kill Hitler was stopped short and the traveler dealt with. History preserved and nuclear holocaust averted.\n\nThen one day when going back to 1945 to see how the war went I was surprised not only that the war hadn't happened, but that Hitler himself was alive and well. He was a painter! Not just a mediocre painter either, he was world famous. He had his own gallery in London and I visited him.\n\nHe was a charming, welcoming man with a family and several children. His studio had a ton of paintings and his life was dedicated to his family and his work. He had never enlisted for the army, never had any fascist views, but he did tell me about his old mentor he met when he was 21. A man with amazing talent for painting who taught him how to perfect his art and be the best person he could be.\n\nThis was something new to me. Rather than kill Hitler it seemed someone went back in time and set his life on a different path. Perhaps this would change things, perhaps this was the cosmic event that could both stop World War II and save the planet from Nuclear War!\n\nAs it turns out however, that was not the case. A quick trip to the future proved as much.\n\nI went back to 1910, found Hitler and his mentor. I could not believe my eyes when I saw who it was! Bob Ross the famous painter from that old TV show I used to watch. Afro and all.\n\nI introduced myself to the two men. There was simply no way I was ever going to kill Bob Ross!\n\nI told my story about how I had been keeping Hitler alive. And to my surprise, Hitler himself wasn't phased by this at all.\n\nHe told me he had been fighting off time travelers since he was a teenager. They usually bolt when he points a gun at them, but some had suffered worse. He had grown to hate the World for this and wanted revenge, until one day Bob came into his life and changed everything. He had come to realize that the path he was on would lead to ruin and horror and so his life was turned around.\n\nI finally told him about what would happen if he didn't follow his old destiny, about how the World would burn if he didn't do the horrible deeds he had originally done. I took them both to the future they created and showed them the destruction.\n\nIt was Hitler himself that suggested the solution. Him, Bob and I would work together to bring Hitler to power, create The Third Reich and set it and themselves up for destruction in 1945. I would make sure no more time travelers tried their luck, Bob would make sure history was preserved, the right nations invaded, the key decisions made and Hitler would play his role of the most wretched man in history.\n\n\n\n\n-------\nIf you read this I'd love to get some feedback!

Adolf cursed softly and thought not again, he was in the middle of drawing a beautiful stick figure walking amongst some roses. The flowers need work he thought, as he put down his crayons. He peeked out a window and saw a man with large curly hair standing politely at his door. Adolf had moved so many times just to get away from these strange people, dressed in outlandish clothes, he was beginning to think there was some kind of conspiracy against him. The first time someone interrupted his paint by numbers marathon. The guy just busted in his apartment brandishing a knife and swinging. Adolf took him out with a nearby brass table lamp and dumped him in a canal. The second and third time happened a day apart. One lady jumped him as he went out for his morning coffee, then a guy with a strange metallic body suit attempted to poke him with an electric handheld device. In both cases Adolf fought back well enough to run away and hide. Since then he has lost count how many people have tried to kill or harm him. \n\nThis was his fifth move in as many months, Adolf thought he was finally free. But no, some guy and his awful hair found him. Knock knock, he heard again. Adolf peeked out again and noticed the man was holding a painting easel, maybe this was a fellow painter he thought, probably noticed my monthly cartoon in Fascistbook. Adolf debated whether to let him in for about four seconds then realized he could use a friend. So he opened the door. \n\n""Hi can I help you.""\n\n""Hello my friend, actually, I can help you"". ""I saw your cartoon in Fascistbook and gave them a visit, they said I could probably find you here."" \n\nDamn, Adolf thought, I told those Semites not to publish my address. ""Well actually I was just in the middle drawing, but I suppose I could spare but a moment.""\n\n""Great! The name is Bob Ross. Mind if I bring my easel in?""\n\nAdolf thought that was a bit presumptuous, what if he had been  painting with the smelly markers. He liked to draw a little mustachio on his upper lip with the licorice smelling ones and flex in the mirror topless. ""Sure why not, not like I have anything to do today."" Nottt, he thought.\n\n""Great then. Just be a chap and grab the other end, it\'s heavy,"" motioning with the easel. \n\nOMG thought Adolf, who does this guy think he is. But he grabbed the easel and walked in with Bob. ""Welcome to the abode Bob, can I get you a drink, schnapps, tea, a bit of arsenic."" He mumbled the last part.\n\n""No thanks a-dawg, I can\'t stay long."" ""In fact, I can only stay for a few minutes, I just wanted to,"" Bob lifted up the easel, ""paint a happy sunset.""\n\nAnd with that Bob swung the easel around and smashed Adolf in the head, splattering blood all over his stick figure and roses drawing. ""Ah, just a little bit of gentle red in the background, a quick smear here, and done, calmly observe your beautiful work of art.""\n', 'As Hitler put down his brush, he saw a flash outside the window, the same flash that he saw every week by the men that came to kill him. Hitler, tired of all these time traveling assassins, was on the verge of deciding to quit painting. If his painting really brought this many people pain, then why would he continue.\n\nThe door flies open, ""Hi, I am Bob Ross and I welcome you to the joy of painting"" as Bob runs into Hitlers home.\n\n""Yoouuu are not here to kill me?"" Hitler stuttered.\n\n""Why would I do that"" Bob replied ""I am here to show you the peace and love that painting can bring to the world""\n\nFor the next few month, Bob sat down with Hitler and showed him the joy of painting. Hitler has never seen so much kindness, he started to find the love in life.\n\nOne rainy afternoon a flash came outside Hitlers window, the door flung open and a man dashed into the room yelling ""Death to Hitler"". He pulled out a gun and fired it at Hitler with no hesitation. The room darkened, the man yelling ""I did it, I killed Hitl..."" he was interrupted by a gunshot. A flash of lighting lit up the room, the man dropped to his knees, clenching his chest where he was just shot. He stared across the room to see Hitler, on his knees, holding Bob in one arm and a gun in the other. \n\n""Why would you kill him, why would you take my joy away"" Hitler yelled.\n\nThe assassin, shocked, replied ""No, I was here to end your life before you destroyed the world. You were supposed to be the one that died, I was going to prevent the evil you brought upon this world.""\n\nHitler lays BoB Ross\' body on the ground and slowly walks over to the assassin.\n\n""Why does everyone want me to be evil?"" Hitler yelled ""If you want me to be evil, so be it"". Hitlers gun fires off, the assassins body hits the floor, the Star of David falling out of his pocket.\n\nThe door of Hitlers house flies open, a Hitler with a long black rain coat walks out, a flash of lightning lights up Hitlers face, eyes cold as ice, as if all his emotion had vanished. The Star of David clenched in his hand so tight that blood was seeping out.\n\nThus the day Hitlers Joy died.', 'Adolf watched ""Bob"" work deftly, as if it was second nature. There was envy and wonder in his eyes, but also suspicion. \n\n""Why do you want to teach me? Why would you do this for me?""\n\n""I don\'t do it for you"" he replied, ""I do it for the world.""\n\nAdolf thought Bob meant that the world deserved his art, that humanity would be missing something without it. Tears welled in his eyes. \n\nThat\'s not what Bob meant, though. ', 'Bob picked up his three inch brush.  Adolf looked on curiously as he didn\'t know what it was to be used for.  Bob had painted big white clouds in a sky of deep phthalo blue.  It wasn\'t the best looking sky, but it was still impressive.  He couldn\'t imagine what Bob would use a three inch brush for, considering the painting to be done.\n\nBob saw the confusion in Adolf\'s eyes.  He explained, ""I\'m just gonna dip the brush in odorless thinner, shake off any excess, and then...""\n\nIn that moment Bob started smacking the brush back and forth on the leg of his easel.  His hair jiggling as if it was one piece instead of thousands of little curls.  He stopped, looked up at young Adolf, with a smirking mouth and a twinkle in his eye, he chuckled, ""And you just beat the devil out of it.""\n\nAdolf felt more confused than before.  He was learning to paint, how ever would odorless paint thinner be used.  Surely it would ruin an otherwise finely painted sky of clouds.  Bob instructed, ""All you do is lightly brush all these little clouds.""\n\nAs Bob brushed, Adolf could see what was happening.  The cloud, lifeless before, began to come alive with motion.  Wisps of titanium white and phthalo blue began to blend into swirls of wind.  A smile came across the eager student\'s face.  He began the process himself, feeling a new found exuberance for painting, realizing that within his easel he could travel to any place he could imagine, and create  lands so beautiful that people would long to go there.\n\nNow, thirty-two years later, Adolf looked on as the chamber filled with gas.  The vapors looked of titanium white and Indian yellow through the small round viewing window in the chamber door.  The screams began.  And a tear rolled down his cheek as he remembered the broken promise to a man who gave him a gift greater than any treasure.  The gift of imagination.', 'On November 23, 1924, wearing a prisoner\'s uniform and an enviable afro, a new inmate appeared in a cell of Landsberg Prison. As he did, a rush of displaced air made a subtle *sprap* and woke the sleeping someday-dictator.\n\n""Well, hi there,"" the new arrival said in German.\n\n""Who are you?!"" said Hitler.\n\n""I\'m Bob Ross.""\n\n""The fuck is a Bob Ross?"" said the future killer of like a bajillion people just for no reason at all. ""Why are you here?""\n\n""Adolf, right? I brought a paint set,"" Ross said, indicating a bag of art supplies. ""Thought we could see what kind of nice things we can discover together. I bet it\'s been a while.""\n\n""How do you know my name? How do you know I paint?""\n\n""Well, it\'s a neat little story. Some folks I\'d never met popped in on me and asked for my help, and what do you know, they sent me to you,"" began the curly-headed man.\n\n""Have you come to release me from here? To unleash the Third Reich? Who sent you?"" \n\n""Oh, just this super bunch I\'ve been enjoying getting to know. Wish you could meet \'em, really. Long story short, they came from the future, taught me German, and sent me along here. I heard you could use a friendly boost to get you painting again. It\'s awfully important you don\'t give up on yourself as an artist."" He drifted a moment, eyes narrowed and distant. Soon they drifted back to the man who was the origin of the phrase *worse than Hitler.* The latter glowered.\n\n""Anyway, they said they\'d ought to linger back, didn\'t want to make too much of a splash, they\'d tried it. Soooo anyway,"" he said, unpacking a paint set and easel, ""I figure we can just have a good ol\' time paintin\'. Might even help you get your groove back. Shall we?""\n\nHe started by drawing his brush through some brilliant blue. Just a nice, bright blue for our sky. Meanwhile, the time travelers\' hidden cameras rolled, collecting oodles of juicy footage for a tell-all VR film, ""The Essential Joy of Painting,"" slated for release in 2050. Just a lot of nice footage, just our little secret.\n\n""Why should I? I\'ve got more important things to do now,"" barked the host to several malignant thought-tumors, motioning with pen in hand. ""Humanity must be unshackled from mediocrity and awakened to its destiny! True patriots, proud whites, men who respect the real meaning of *Master Race,* must rise to our full potential--""\n\n""Well, now, let me pause you right there, friend. I\'ve skittered through Mein Kampf and, no sirree, this here brush is the main thing you\'ve got to master."" He indicated an extra palette and brush he\'d set aside.\n\n""You think I would trade Utopia for some lost art school fantasy? I will ring in humanity\'s finest age.""\n\nBob shrugged. ""Wellll, the truth might be a little too grim,"" he grinned, or grimaced. ""I figure we just jump right into the good stuff instead here."" Sensing a pause, he let his pitch drop from sunny to serious, but he kept his smile. \n\n""Look. Adolf. This is your fullest potential, right here. The future hangs in the balance. Now, I\'ll hand it to you -- you got gumption... one way or another, the world will remember you as a powerful leader. You\'re the one who decides where to lead. Will you take the art world into a new golden age, or the lead the whole world into a nasty war over -- pardon my potty talk -- a buncha grade A malarkey?"" Swishing his brush in nice circles, he made happy little clouds appear, just all over.

Will try to finish up tomorrow. If you want it, PM me and I will share it with you.)', 'November, 2017. A month right before everything went wrong. It all started out with that repeal of net neutrality. Almost immediately, the ISP\'s began to go back on their promises that they wouldn\'t limit access for customers. Within a few months, the ISP\'s managed to stratify the internet by wealth. Internet culture came to a screeching halt in early 2018 as numerous websites deemed as ""high bandwidth content"" began to go bland and die due to severe restrictions on their access by the general public. There was outrage, of course, but like with many things, the fury died down, and people accepted that this is the way the world was. Slowly but surely, more and more websites began to disappear from the web as their content became more and more restricted. The ISP\'s became all the more powerful, as they aggressively tried to buy out platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, and other social media to further advance their profit margins. The websites that resisted the buyouts were strangled to death with access restrictions. By the time Trump was impeached for the 9th and final time, the damage his negligence caused was irreversible. The ISP\'s had become all powerful. All information passed through them, and secretly, they were in the process of merging behind the scenes into one massive conglomerate ISP. When the federal government tried to break them up, the conglomerate ISP, eventually known as The Provider, shut down all government services. It was chaos. Since the Provider controlled the flow of all information, it was easy to paint the situation as a failure of governance. The Provider was more than happy to take the mantle as the New Government of the United States.\n\nThe year is now 2038. If George Orwell could see the world we are living in, he would die of terror. Three years ago, the Provider mandated that all people have a chip installed in their brains. They were sold as a ""virtualized access chips"", but that was only on the surface. These were Death Chips. These chips knew the account balance of the people they were implanted in, and if that balance did not qualify for certain levels for information access on the Net, then higher brain function was reduced. These chips literally reduced the thinking capacity of those with low account balances, so much so to create a slave race of drone workers. If an unhappy soul reaches 0, well... brain death.\n\nA few of us escaped the implementation of the chips. For three years, we have been living off the grid in the wastes of Montana, fighting back against the Provider, although never with resounding success. That was until a couple weeks ago. A crazed old man who claims to be a scientists came to us about a year ago with this insane idea about time travel. He said he used to work for the Provider, in their research and development department. When he realized they were entrusting him to create a time machine for the purpose of rewritting history to suit their diabolical needs, he took all their research, and fled, making sure to purge all information relating to the project. We all thought he was crazy, but now it seems he was right. As we prepare to send our first agents back in time to sabatage the ISP\'s before they sprout their evil, I try to think of a world where digital information is free flowing and equal. As I step into 2017 to fulfill my assigned mission, I shed a single tear seeing how free and open the internet is. It must be protected. At all cost.', 'As I sat in my darkened bedroom, with only the ghostly glow of my computer screen and the click-clack of my keyboard for company.  I scan through the news feeds, searching for anything that‚Äôll pique my interest, then I see it.\n\n‚ÄúAmericans continue to fight for net neutrality‚Äù I murmured the headline to myself.\n\nThen it dawned on me, they‚Äôd been fighting it for twenty years, whilst the rest of the world carried on, with free access to the internet.\n\nThe little voice in my head commented ‚Äústill don‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù.\n\nAnd so I carried on with my life, like the other 95.7% of the world. ', 'It\'s January 19th, 2038. For years, Susan had been working in secret on her time machine. Her goal? Not to kill Hitler. Not to stop Trump. Not to meet Jesus. Her goal is to make it so she can watch Netflix and download games on Steam without having to pay an extra premium. A noble, but petty goal, all things considered. \n\nShe sets the time circuits to November 23rd, 2017. She sees this as the pivotal turning point -- Thanksgiving Day. The day that everyone in the United States is at home with their families, and most likely watching Football or the Macy\'s parade. When it will be easiest to get their attention. \n\nShe thinks she has it all figured out. She\'s tested the machine a few times before to go backwards days and even weeks. This will be her biggest jump. Ironically, much like the original Delorean in Back to the Future her ship is fueled by raw plutonium. Also, ironically, thanks to the Trump regime (which has been in power for 20 years thanks to a military coup) she lives in a Libertarian utopia (by which I mean a dystopia) and you can buy plutonium at the corner drug store, just as Doc Brown joked about in Back to the Future. Anyway, enough about how great of a movie Back to the Future is.\n\nThe amount of plutonium it depletes is based on how far into the past she travels. She\'s figured out the exact ratio needed for 2017. In order to be safe and not run out, she\'s purchased ten times the required amount. She has no plans of getting stranded like in some dumb TV show or movie.\n\nBut she\'s made one specific error. One that would not have exposed itself until this very day, this very hour, this very minute, this very second. Somewhere in the hardware of her time machine, between the interface of the time circuits and the hardware that actually does the quantum calculation on how much fuel to use to bend time and space, there\'s a chip that takes a 64 bit integer and converts it to a 32 bit one if that number can losslessly be converted. This is an undocumented feature of the chip used to help it do calculations faster. An optimization created by a machine learning algorithm that creates most modern chips of her day.\n\nThe impact of this bug is that her time machine is unknowingly affected by the Unix Epoch Bug. As the machine is warming up, the clock ticks over to 03:14:07 UTC. Instead of the time calculation being for -17 years, 1 month, 27 days, from January 19th, 2038, it gets calculated as -17 years, 1 month, 27 days from December 13th, 1901, also known as October 27th, 1884. And because she took ten times the required fuel, which would have enabled her to do ~200 years worth of time travel, the machine happily consumes 3/4 of her fuel to send her 154 years back in time, stranding her with only enough fuel to make it less than a third of the way back home.\n\nAs the machine hums to life, nothing seems out of the ordinary to Susan. She\'s transferred all her data to a 20-year-old laptop so she\'ll be able to interface with older computers easily. She\'s brought what she hopes will be enough information to prove to people that not only is she from the future, but that net neutrality is the number one issue that people should be concerned about for the future. More important that global warming, ISIS, North Korea, the 2025 war with Russia, any of that. If only they\'d had consistent download speeds, all of that could have been avoided and all those problems solved!\n\nAlso at this time I\'d like to point out that 21 years (2038 to 2017) is greater than two decades, not ""almost two decades."" Anyway, I digress.\n\nA flash and a sudden jolt later, and Susan is in 1884. She\'d picked the location of her time jump knowing that it would be an empty field in 2017. But in 1884 it was a dense forest. It had not yet been cleared for a cow pasture. There was no Google Street View for her to reference that far back to confirm. There\'s a small explosion, several pops, and a burning smell as tree trunks around her burst outward as they\'re displaced in spacetime by her vehicle. A few seconds later, she hears creaking as the damaged trunks bend and break as the trees awkwardly fall around her. She nervously waits out the unexpected cataclysm, hoping it\'s over. ""What the fuck?"" she demands, annoyed and frustrated. Then she looks at the time circuits. ""What the fuck. God damn it.""\n\n*How did this happen?* she thinks to herself. *I took so many precautions. I tested it so many times. So many simulations. How the hell did this happen?* But unfortunately for her, because the chip I mentioned earlier was developed using machine learning, it was essentially a black box in her simulation. Whenever she had tested the chip, the inputs and outputs gave her the values she expected. When she simulated the chip, it was only simulated in terms of its expected inputs and outputs. And she\'d never tested it when the current date was after the end of the Unix Epoch. She just hadn\'t considered it. She never intended to travel to the future, only the past. By 2037, nearly all modern computers and software had long ago been fixed to work around or account for the bug. It just wasn\'t something people thought about anymore. It seemed like a solved problem.\n\nShe activated the augmented reality system that would allow her to look outside the vehicle quickly without leaving it, in order to assess if anything had been damaged. There were some tree trunks leaning on the vehicle and some dents, but overall it seemed to not have taken too much damage. The noise of her arrival also didn\'t seem to have attracted any unwanted attention. She checked her fuel gauge: slightly less than a quarter remaining. If she activated the ship now to go forward, she could barely make it to 1930. Not good enough. No one would even know what the internet was at that time!\n\nShe sat and thought for a few more minutes. *What if I did something like, living one year normally, then traveling forward a year using the time machine? How far could I get that way?* 1976. Plus that would take up literally 46 years of her life, and put the time machine at risk of being stolen or breaking in the interim. And people would still barely know what the internet was! *What if I found more fuel? When was plutonium discovered anyway? Could I use an alternative fuel? Uranium maybe?* She opened her laptop and went to her offline copy of Wikipedia. *Good thing I paid my ISP for Wikipedia Premium service in order to quickly download the entire database before embarking on this trip.* she thought to herself. And then immediately admonished herself for thinking that way. *No! Fuck that! That\'s exactly the bullshit I came back to fight against! Fuck paying a premium just to have Wikipedia move faster than a 56k modem! Great. Now I\'m pissed off again.* She vowed to herself that her mission must succeed!\n\n>Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940 by a deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. First neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) was synthesized which subsequently beta-decayed to form this new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 87.7 years). Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was considered to be a planet as well.\n\n*Those idiots, still considering Pluto a planet. People in the past were so dumb. So, 1940. That\'s only ten years of my life wasted. I think that\'s do-able.* Then, hating herself for doing it, she brought up the article on Back to the Future. *1885. And I ended up in 1884. What a stupid coincidence. Well, almost-coincidence. Maybe it\'s not a coincidence and so much of my work has intersected with that movie because I accidentally leave some information in the past? Nah. It\'s got to be a coincidence.*\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to make a 2038 Unix Epoch Bug joke.', ""I remembered seeing this back now. \n\nI thought I should stop by to 2017 on my way back to bitch-slap Karl Marx, and let you all know that it all ends up okay. All of this protesting gets us nowhere, and they do succeeded in banning net neutrality, but the free market saves us. It always does.  \n\nAround mid 2018, despite all of their promises to the contrary, AT&T and Verizon began capitalising on their duopoly. For a few months the future looked truly bleak as people started going outside and getting exposed to the sun, and other people. Necks were shaved, showers were had, it was horrible. \n\nBut seemingly out of nowhere - although in hindsight we really should have trusted in the wisdom of Ajit Pai - smaller ISP's started popping up all along the east coast. The cynics in us outwardly dismissed them and their dreams for a better world; Didn't they know that the corporations and their evil capitalism were too great an opponent? But secretly we all hoped they would succeed and allow us to return to our slovenly ways.\n\nAnd succeed they did! It wasn't immediately clear how, but over time it was revealed that many of the big content providers had been preparing for just this eventuality. By 2025 Google alone had seeded over 9000 smaller ISP's across the nation. It wasn't fast, and there were many lawsuits, but by time President Trump suffered that fatal aneurysm, we were all safely back in our hovels, bingeing on the latest forgettable rubbish, and spewing our arbitrary opinions into the void.\n\nStill, you are here now, and you can not know that this is other than a fictitious tale.

Under the cover of war the 22nd Amendment was abolished and Trump repeatedly won re-election.

Anyone with evidence of a protestor\'s identity was rewarded with 1 TV Shows bandwidth of streaming.

Ok, maybe not my Facebook feed, but my twitter feed had blown up with people that I followed also not believing what had happened over in America.\n\nGoing back to our home country, I didn‚Äôt like what I was thinking about. If Australia also accepted these laws then that would mean we would be affected and our internet providers (Telstra, Optus, iiNet) could do those exact deals against Australian customers and we as a family is going to be affected.\n\nFor me though, I needed to get away from this reality. A reality that for me did feel right after all of the stuff that has just gone down. Now if my laptop would work, it was time to quickly head over to my FM17 game as at least that won‚Äôt be able to be affected by these new laws that are in play. Or I hope it won‚Äôt be affected.\n\nDecember 15, 2037: \nAs I got into my car, I ask my car to see what the news of the day was. Thinking that much like any other day, it was probably the same thing that usually did happen.\n\n‚ÄúHere is the news for December 15, 2037,‚Äù the voice said as it showed the news stories coming from the one source.\n\nI quickly looked through the news stories, thinking that nothing would happen all across the world. A quick search though found the headline that I was surprised to see come up on my newsfeed.\n\nUnited States: Net Neutrality ‚Äì 20 years on\n\nThinking that it was a weird title for a story, I asked to check the article. This opened up the news article, telling that today was the 20th year since the bill past back in 2017. During that time the internet in America as has been limited with the ISPs battling each other to get more money from their customers than their rivals. As I read on, I saw the number of companies that had jumped ship from America over to other parts of the world. From Facebook moving over to the United Kingdom to Rooster Teeth moving to Australia, it not only damaged the American brand but the control of the internet in general.\n\nOf course, I knew that Australia lasted a bit longer than the Americans with free internet speech not being brought up until the following year. Despite the problems though, they passed the bill to remove net neutrality and the population didn‚Äôt like it. \n\nFirst, they didn‚Äôt legalise same-sex marriage because of religious issues. This was even when most of the population voted for it to be implanted. Then they passed a bill to stop net neutrality and give rights to the ISPs. This basically turns the internet into another round of pay TV. This moment though, made people snap as they didn‚Äôt like to lose free access from the internet. From schools to the average person, the internet was officially a way of life. For it to be taken away, meant a loss of freedom.\n\nFor me personally, it made going through TAFE that year tough. This was because most of the course was online. With the new laws though, it now was behind a paywall, that people had to pay to get in. I didn‚Äôt want this to be the case, why did have Australia have to follow America with this rule when they could do their own thing.\nProtests and rallies were done all across the country with all of them having one goal. To change the law back to how it was before all of this happened. The positive was that it was working for a short while and we generally thought that it would get it back. We were wrong on that front as the Liberal government weren‚Äôt moving from where they stand on the matter.\n\nLabor though was and when the 2019 elections came round, they swiftly defeated the Liberals. The first act was to overturn the ban on free internet access and it was a win for all of who tried to get support. We as a country had done it and had access to the free roam of the internet once again. But that swing of support though didn‚Äôt change the minds of the American ISPs as they stuck to their ground and since that day, they have been controlled internet much like the North Korea of the time.\n\nAs I went back to the modern day, I hear a ringtone and answered it, ‚ÄúHello, who is this.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is me,‚Äù the caller said in a cheerful tone.\n\n‚ÄúOh hey, Sam, what is the news over there like in Canada? Any anime I am missing out on,‚Äù I replied gratefully.\n\n‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt what I called you for, I have called you because I have the invented the time travel machine to go back to 2017 and bring back America,‚Äù he gracefully replied.\n\n‚ÄúWhy are you even trying, America is gone now. Give up on that dream of bringing your southern cousins back.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI will not stand for this, twenty years is too long and it is time to set them free from this mess. I am going to change history hopefully for the better.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOk then, but you won‚Äôt be able to go to back to this timeline as that simple event has consequences.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI know that I have to go now.‚Äù\nWith that, he ended the call. I couldn‚Äôt believe what he was doing, this didn‚Äôt feel like a good idea for him to change history.', '[removed]', 'Yatrop, Dirk, and Jop had finally managed to achieve time travel, arriving in 2017.\n\n""Finally, we have arrived in 2017,"" they all say.\n\n""Now we can prevent net neutrality from being murdered,"" says Dirk with great happiness.\n\nHowever, Yatrop and Jop look at him strangely.\n\n""Dirk,"" they say, ""How come you are so fixated on this? It was perhaps unfortunate that smaller companies and users were disadvantaged in their internet usage, but this fact seems rather trivial considering our success in time travel.""\n\n""Yatrop and Jop,"" says Dirk, ""I had not thought of it that way. Besides, less reliable internet meant less mouth-breathers wasting away on reddit. It was actually very good for public health. Just look around at all these 2017 losers, who are abolished in our beautiful 2038.""\n\nThe three were then in happy agreement and continued to be until their eventual deaths.\n\nThe End', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs finally ready.‚Äù\n\nI stood back and marvelled at our creation. We had taken an ordinary refrigerator, and turned it into a time machine.\n\nNow, you might ask, why we did this.\n\nBuilding the time machine was just the first part of our mission. We knew that this was our only hope of restoring freedom to the Internet. That freedom had been taken away 20 years ago. I was just a child at that time, so I had no memory of it. I thought back to that fateful day when I discovered the truth.\n\nThe year was 2024. My grandfather had died, and left my parents, my sister, and I ‚Äúa very important box‚Äù in his will. Inside the box was what appeared to be a pile of radio aerials and computer chips, along with a note.\n\n> For the past few years, I have attempted to discover the secret of time-travel. I have made a fair bit of progress, but I will not be around to see the results of my work. The time has come for you to continue my work. Once you have created a working time machine with these spare parts, go back to 2017 and ensure that Net Neutrality is preserved. Remember, Ajit Varadaraj Pai opposes Net Neutrality. Good luck!\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Net Neutrality?‚Äù I remembered asking.\n\nDad then sat down with me, and started talking. ‚ÄúBack when you were just a baby, the Internet was not as you know it today. Back then, it didn‚Äôt matter if a website or service was a tiny minnow in a sea of sharks: you could still access it the same way you access anything else on the internet. But that all changed in 2017. Now, many websites and services have been blocked, throttled, or put behind a paywall, severely restricting what could be done on the Internet.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo back then, you didn‚Äôt have to pay a monthly fee to browse Reddit?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúPrecisely,‚Äù said Dad.\n\nI then nodded, brimming with determination.\n\nFor the next 14 years, we got to work at building a time machine. At first, my involvement with the project was limited to passing a wrench every once in a while. Eventually, I got involved with the proverbial heavy lifting.\n\nNow, it was finally time for us to go back and set right what went wrong. Dad pressed a few buttons on a remote control, then stashed the controller in a small backpack. He climbed into the fridge wearing the backpack, then the rest of us followed.\n\n‚ÄúBit of a tight squeeze,‚Äù my sister mused. Before any of us could respond, we felt the fridge lifting up into the air and spinning. After what felt like an eternity, the spinning stopped. The door of the fridge then opened. We were in a lush, green field, with several houses in the distance.\n\n‚ÄúNow to find this Ajit Pai fellow,‚Äù said Mum. ‚ÄúBut, where are we?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have no idea where we are, but I know exactly when we are,‚Äù said Dad. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the 1st of November, 2017.‚Äù\n', 'When The Blinding first occurred, I thought I was the only individual affected. I was sitting at my desk working on a school paper and in an instant, everything went black. \n\nI had cried out to my parents in fear and confusion, but their response was like an echo of my own. They, too, couldn\'t see. And we soon learned the entire world had been victim to having their sight filled with darkness. Interestingly enough, we don\'t think this affected any of the animals living on Earth. Just us humans. The only strange thing that occurred after this was the fact that the demand for Milk skyrocketed. \n\nAt first, adapting was extremely difficult. Something as mundane and simple as using the bathroom had become a daily challenge I didn\'t look forward to.  \n\nWithin a few months, support groups had been created by individuals who were already blind prior to the incident. They assisted those who were struggling with adapting to their newfound obstacle. \n\nThankfully, the world never really stopped moving or progressing. Outside of major adjustments that had to be made, such as devising a different mode of transportation or different requirements and standards in the working world, we managed to pull through.\n\nIt\'s been about 2 years since The Blinding and there were times where I had forgotten such an event occured. \n\nI was taking a short walk to the store to get some groceries. I don\'t know why, but I\'ve developed an almost dependency like state on milk. I had gripped the handle to the door to the small grocery store and pushed the door open. A bell was hung on the inside handle of the door.\n\n""Hello, let me know if you need help finding anything."" A voice said to my right.\n\n""Thanks, Dave. I will."" I responded.\n\n""Hey John! How\'ve you been?"" he asked with a somewhat enthusiastic tone. \n\nWith a somewhat slow pace I walked around the store, feeling along the brail to determine if I had found my item. \n\n""Pretty much the same"" I said with a bit of a chuckle. \n\nMy hand touched something cold. Finally. Found the milk.\n\nAs I was about to open the door I could see my reflection in the rectangle shaped window of the cooler. \n\nI wasn\'t entirely sure how to react nor was I sure as to what happened. I was looking. At myself. In a mirror. For the first time in two years.\n\nI started shaking and I could feel warmth and moisture filling my eyes. \n\nI noticed writing on the reflection itself. I was so excited I hadn\'t even noticed. In fact, most of the interior was covered in this writing. Looked a little closed at the message written in black.\n\n*Don\'t tell them you can see.*\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? Who\'s them?\n\nI then caught a glimpse of the individual standing behind the counter of the store. \n\nWho...what the fuck is that...\n\n""John? You need some help buddy?"" it asked. It had Dave\'s voice, but it definitely wasn\'t Dave. And the way it\'s mouth moved was...\n\nWait, is that it\'s mouth? I have no idea.\n\nI was staring at something that was at least 6 feet tall. Grotesque and eldritch was the only way I could describe it. It\'s dark brown skin was smooth and moist with extremely tiny openings in its skin. It wasn\'t wearing any type of clothing.   It\'s arms were somewhat long and thin looking appendages that ended in human looking hands. Its head was shaped like a large Basket Ball. The creatures mouth looked to be in a vertical position and when it spoke I could see many layers and rows of crocodile like teeth.\n\n""Here John, let me come help."" It said. Its voice had changed as well. It was gurgled and sounded like it was being put through a filter.\n\n As it moved I could hear it squish against the floor. That\'s the first time I\'ve ever heard that. Why am I hearing that just now? Why have I never heard that before?\n\nInstead of gaping at the reflection and trying to ascertain how it walks, I simply stared at a jug of milk. \n\nThat\'s when I noticed the color of the milk. It wasn\'t white or brown or any color a milk should be. It was dark black.\n\nAs the creature grew closer a foul smell harassed my nostrils. It took everything I had not to vomit.\n\nIt reached out with it\'s human like appendage and touched my shoulder. \n\nMy entire body tensed up. \n\n""We\'re having a lot of different specials on milk today."" It said and I could see its mouth open wide behind my head with what I assumed was a smile.', '[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cvstw8/the_great_blinding_part_2/) is available!\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cw5hjc/the_great_blinding_part_3/) is available!\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cx4djl/the_great_blinding_part_4/)\n\n*****\n\nI was maimed in the Great Blinding just like everybody else. One day the world was a colorful pastel full of life and movement and the next day we were blind. Not just some of us. Everybody was blind. Color became something that *was* instead of something that *is*. I could pick up an apple and not know if it was red or green or yellow or maybe it was just something made to feel like an apple. For a time I would talk about the delicate red feathers of a cardinal I could hear chirping outside my bedroom window. Soon it was just a cardinal, and finally it was just a bird. We lost color, and with the color left a little part of us. \n\nI felt the life trickle out of me the longer I was enveloped in darkness. Walks at the park were monotonous now, meaningless as the darkness there was as dark as the darkness anywhere else. I could feel the leaves; the little veins that coursed up from the stem and the ridges and edges of the bark of a tree. I could hear the splash of water when I tossed a rock into the pond but I could no longer see the ripples of the water or the ducks scurrying away. I knew there should be a meaning to all this, some entity encouraging me to learn to utilize my other senses or to appreciate the sounds of the world, but all I could think of was how beautiful it all used to be. \n\nIt has been two years since the Blinding. Two years of darkness. Two years of indoctrination. Verbal illumination, as they called it. We were told what we would see if we could see. We were told how it should look and what it should mean and why things were never quite the way we thought they were. It has been two years since the Blinding, and it has been two hours since I opened my eyes and things were different again.\n\nMy world was no longer black when I awoke, suddenly a long unfamiliar contrast between my eyes being open and my eyes being closed. It was offputting but relieving; terrifying but intriguing. There was color again. Not the beautiful oranges and reds and greens of autumn leaves, but at least there was more than just darkness. \n\nThe walls were grey and the world was foggy. Shapes turned to letters as I read the words scrawled on my bedroom walls. ""Don\'t tell them you can see,"" I deciphered, barely construing the different shades of grey that outlined the words. So I didn\'t. The paranoia overtook me as I hid my vision from whatever power had rendered me blind. I did my best to play it off, to not look at the little grey bird perched on my windowsill and to hide my excitement from my colleagues. I went about my day as I would a blind man, using my hands like feelers as I groped and grasped my way about.\n\nI tapped away at the keyboard on my desk, the lifeless machine reciting back to me my keystrokes and any information it considered relevant to my role. The firm had adopted seamlessly to the Blinding, installing backup measures as if they had been preparing them for years. I peaked. It was the same monotony it had always been.\n\nIn the bathroom I saw the words again, etched into the mirror they hadn\'t bothered to remove. Why would they, after all? We were all blind and mired in the misery of endless introspection. Mirror or no mirror, it made no difference. Everything was grey; the colors no more diverse than light grey and grey and dark grey. But there were those words again, ""Don\'t tell them you can see."" I just stood there, looking at myself. My clothes were grey and my face was grey and my eyes that had once been the faintest shade of blue were grey and lifeless as the darkness we were supposed to be in.\n\nI shook my head. I fought back the sadness. I had assumed until now that color still was; if the darkness ever ended, the birds I heard would still be yellow and blue and red and the plants would still have green leaves and purple flowers. Instead they were all grey. I told myself that it was my vision, not that somebody had removed the colors themselves from our beautiful world. I found comfort in convincing myself that my vision was still impaired. The alternative was far worse.\n\nOutside the office, the street was grey and the sky was grey and the buildings that stretched towards that grey sky blended into the clouds just a slightly different shade of grey. But as I looked out, a flash of color caught my eye. A man stood in the shadows of a building, looking out at me from an alleyway as grey as everything else. His shirt was red and his pants were blue and even from this distance I could see the pink of his skin. It dawned on me that if he had color then the birds really were grey and my curiosity struggled to overcome the overwhelming sadness I felt. He stared, and when I finally met his eyes he waved me towards him and disappeared into the alley.\n\n*****\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cvstw8/the_great_blinding_part_2/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cw5hjc/the_great_blinding_part_3/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cx4djl/the_great_blinding_part_4/)\n\n*****\n\nThanks for reading!

History named it The Great Blinding. What that doesn\'t entail is that it was our own damn fault. The world was wrought into chaos after several months of warnings and we simply elected to ignore them, feigning assurance - ""Oh that\'ll go away once we start on it."" \n\n""That\'s no problem for the government. They\'ll take care of us."" \n\n""Don\'t get involved, you\'ll just get in the way of the experts."" \n\nUltimately, no one did anything about it because they thought others were on top of the problem. Indeed, this led to a fading away of layers of ozone that prevented the full wrath of the sun. The ozone wasn\'t fully gone, no but enough that the light truly lit up the earth. When it was day, we were all doomed. No corner of darkness could hide us. It took mere seconds and we were caught. There were legends of a group of roamers traveling eternally into the night, never letting the day come upon them. It\'s been 2 years since... The night doesn\'t last very long. We don\'t walk by sight anymore. We walk by faith. In faith, we sense the heat. We developed patterns of excursions into the dark. The already blind, we called them Ushers of Darkness, led us. They knew the world unlike us. We fell into line. We worshiped them. They walked the world, took us places with cool air, cold water, taught us to feel the world around us.\n\nThen it happened. Colors poured into my periphery, filling my vision. At first, I was confused. Dreaming? Tripping? Then everything settled in place. The world stood in plain view. I was astonished at what I saw... Scribblings everywhere, didn\'t matter how far I went, even on the people themselves, myself included - ""Don\'t tell them you can see."" Granted, it was all dim since we were hiding in the dark but there was enough.\n\nI wasn\'t sure what would happen if I did tell them despite the warning so I played along. I saw where the Ushers of Darkness led us. They led us through dangerous places but on safe paths, balancing on a thin rope death and life... I nearly got caught myself veering off the path because of my insatiable curiosity. As time went on, I got better at keeping up the act. It became dreary... I wish I could be blind again. We couldn\'t do much anyway. We were holed up from the sun\'s wrath.\n\nThen I started feeling something was off... No one was talking. It was pure silence. Yet we kept doing the same things again and again, our excursions in the dark to scavenge, then back to our darkly caves with oases. But silence. I tried to talk but was afraid I\'d slip up and show I could see. After all, what we talk about tend to be what we feel or see. The risks simply weren\'t worth it. Then I thought a thought...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat if they all could see?', 'Most people lost their sight waking up on the morning of the first day, as the event started in the middle of the night. The change only occurred as one slept, so others attempted to remain awake to retain their vision for longer. This effort proved to be pointless, as the effects took hold the moment they closed their eyes and started to doze. As the days stretched into weeks, Microsleep ended up taking of the vision of the most resilient.\n\nAdjusting to the change was difficult, but there was ease in knowing that everyone was blind, and that we all shared the same struggle. Those that were blind *before* the change became valuable assets to their communities. They found themselves teaching thousands, in neighborhoods where there were no blind people before.\n\nI spent my time at home, with my animals, listening to old reruns of my favorite TV shows. Years of mental health issues had rendered me unfit to work in the eyes of the state, so many aspects of my life continued as usual. I did miss reading and, although I managed to find a few books in braille, it wasn\'t that simple to learn. The small dots weren\'t that clear to me as someone who had recently gone blind. Walking the trails around my house was not an option anymore either.\n\nThat was then, though. Today, something changed that I didn\'t anticipate would happen. For the first time in over 785 days, I saw something.\n\nThere have been stories since The Great Blinding of people regaining their sight. In all cases so far, it has been attributed to an overactive imagination. I must admit that even I have been fooled into thinking I was seeing something. You catch what looks like a flash of light, but it quickly fades and you are reminded that you are still blind, and that it has been the case for over a year now.\n\nToday was different. I saw the flash of light, but it quickly expanded to cover my entire field of view. I had to remind myself that I had a field of view again. I was amazed at how much I could see again, but startled at how *forward* everything felt. In my blindness, I experienced my world in 360 degrees. Now, I was seeing only what was in front of me, and I noted how unaware I was of this before. My ears were still trained to the world of the blind however, so I found myself more aware of my surroundings than I remembered being before The Great Blinding.\n\nWords started to appear in my vision. At first unfamiliar, but then more clear as the image of what each letter meant reappeared in my minds eye. I had forgotten what letters looked like.\n\n\'Do not tell them that you can see\' were the words scrawled on my wall. The writing was brown, and it had no stench. I looked around to see if there was evidence that someone entered my room while I slept, but I soon realized that the substance was dried and old. Someone wrote this on my wall a long time ago, and I had no idea why.\n\nI crept out of my room and realized that the sun was starting to set. After so long without sight, I wasn\'t surprised that my sleep cycle was so off. For me, it felt like early morning.\n\nThe sky was illuminated with streamers of light, and everywhere people wandered through the streets, heading for work. The setting sun turned the sky a rich burgundy striped with its golden rays. There were no stars in this sky. In the distance, the trees danced, casting their long shadows on the surrounding fields. Looking closer, I realized they were actually dancing. Tall branches were swaying with their movements as they spun around one another and held each others\' arms.\n\nNearby, the people continued with their lives, unaware of the beings in their midst. Translucent birds flew high in the sky and shattered against the stone clouds only to congeal and reform as a different bird. Their chirps mimicking those of any birds I knew of before The Great Blinding. Orbs of light illuminated and disappeared as they moved through the air, sometimes passing through people, unbeknownst to them.\n\nThere were no roads or vehicles in the street. The asphalt and gravel were replaced with fields of grass; despite this, my feet clattered on the ground as if it were still made of stone. I was so absorbed in my changed surroundings, it was hard to take in. In the distance I heard whispers and, as I narrowed my eyes, I caught sight of a person waving at me to come near. I approached with caution, not knowing who or what they might be.\n\n""Get in here!"" They pointed at my house. ""Before they notice me."" I retreated through the door, and faced the man who was invading my home. ""Do you have any idea what you are looking at?"" He spoke quietly, and stared out the window. The red glare of the night sky cast his face in a bloodied shadow. ""You have entered the world of the dead.‚Äù He closed the blinds. ‚ÄúYou are witnessing things you were never supposed to see.‚Äù\n\n**Edit: Hey!

As if the lights of my mind had been shuttered off and then on again by the huge hand of a god.\n\nI froze there. I did my best not to look surprised. I just kept staring ahead at the blurry grey wall of my apartment, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Of the fact that I *was* seeing. No one had seen anything in over two years.\n\nNot that I could ever see well. My vision was even worse than normal, a milky blur filtering out the world.\n\nMaybe I was dying. Maybe this was one last vivid, terrific hallucination of the world as it used to be.\n\nMy eyes burned like I\'d fallen asleep with my contacts in, a feeling I hadn\'t had to worry about since the day I woke up just as blind as the rest of the world. I reached up and rubbed hard at them until the fog cleared. \n\nThere was a handwritten note there above my television. A careful little army of letters, marching forward. I leapt off the couch and beelined toward it, until my nose was nearly touching the drywall. Close enough to be able to read for the first time since the Blinding. \n\nThe message said, in a stranger\'s handwriting, DON\'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.\n\nA dark hand coiled around my spine. I knew exactly who they meant. There was only one class of people who escaped unscathed during the Blinding. They were the very same who installed the radio in my wall, who kept all of human society going. Only us fully biological humans lost our ability to see.\n\nMy stare darted to the radio, still humming away in its slot on the wall. The radio had a single  black dial, a speaker, and a shiny black circle I had never been able to see before. The government had subsidized these devices as a way to help us all adjust to the new change of waking up suddenly and horribly blind. \n\nThe radio spun out some light oldies tune. How long had it noticed? Had it yet noticed?\n\nWould *they* notice?\n\nI spun away from the wall and pawed around on the floor, pretending to look for something I dropped. I tried to keep my stare blank, unfocused, but in the corner of my eye, I watched that radio.\n\nI watched that strange, shiny black circle I had never seen before.\n\nI felt foolish and stupid, kneeling there on the floor, doing my best to pretend to be blind. I should be running cheering down the street. I should be going to the nearest hospital to figure out what the hell I did that no one else could do. \n\nBut then another set of letters caught my eye. There, in black marker on the inner leg of my coffee table.\n\nNow I didn\'t have the room in my mind to think about danger or consequences.\n\nI stood up on trembling legs, and I turned my head to look boldly all around my apartment. \n\nEvery wall carried words. Some of them looked like they had been scrubbed and painted over, random patches of mismatching grey paint here or there. \n\nOver and over, every surface of my apartment screamed at me: DON\'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.\n\nA knock rattled my front door.\n\nI snapped my head toward it, then quickly away again. I tried my best to remember what it felt like *not* to see. How I held my head. Whether I kept my eyes open or shut or half-lidded, almost dead-eyed. \n\nThen I paused there, opening and closing my fists at my side.\n\nI did my best to gather what information I knew. \n\nI knew I was the first living, breathing human to see in over two years. I knew the shock on my face must have given me away by now. \n\n""Ma\'am,"" a robotic voice intoned at the door. ""Please do me the courtesy of opening up.""\n\nAnd whoever was on the other side of my door, they sure as hell weren\'t human. Not fully. And something told me they weren\'t here to help. \n***\n/r/shoringupfragments\n\nMmm I\'m not capable of writing short apparently! ~~Spinning up a part 2~~ \n\nHere\'s [part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/cvoaso/wp_you_lost_your_sight_along_with_everyone_else/ey5in0q/) :) Thanks for reading', 'When I first regained my sight I saw the messages, ""Don\'t tell them you can see"".\n\nI wondered who ""them"" might be. I\'ll be honest, my first thought was space aliens of some sort of monsters from a Stygian realm. I was terrified.\n\nI carefully got out my cane and went about my business, often closing my eyes to make the subterfuge more believable.\n\nThen I saw my first glimpse of the truth. We were ""them"". The scant few that could see were chained or harnessed to work for the blind masses.\n\nNot down on the grubby streets where most of us eeked out our living, mind you. There was a military, or industrial wealth class that had quickly seized the few who had never gone blind.\n\nIn the first days of The Great Blinding there had been a few helpful souls that had not succumbed according to the rumors. But the rumors faded when everyone realized the\'d never met a sighted person or became unsure of their memories of those first few traumatic days.\n\nOver time it was revealed that a few people took longer to lose their sight.\n\nAnd so many people died in those first weeks that who was to say when someone simply disappeared.\n\nBut now I could glance across distant vistas and through chain link fences at the sighted slaves doing the work only sighted people can do. Tethered and beaten, the slaves, some hobbled by broken or missing feet, could glare defiance, and leave messages that the blind overseers couldn\'t detect.\n\nThe words were in mismatched paints or organic stains.\n\nThe words were in the margins of the braille paperwork.\n\nThe messages were passed by a one in a thousand moment of eye contact and a nodding head as you pass on the street.\n\nIn the land of the blind the sighted man is not king. He is valuable property.\n\nBut revolution is brewing.', 'It returned as quickly as it was taken away. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for it, and now rather than being blinded by darkness, I was blinded by bright light. I stumbled backwards and fell to my knees, my hands gripping the brick wall behind me. I closed my tearing eyes and blinked slowly, trying to get readjusted to the light.\n\nTwo years ago The Darkness came. I had been cutting tomatoes for my wife, Jane, who was saut√©ing vegetables when the world went black. I cried out, blinking furiously, my hands clawing at my face. I heard a similar cry behind me.\n\n‚ÄúBen, Ben, I can‚Äôt see! Somethings wrong, I can‚Äôt see!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJane, I can‚Äôt either. We need to call for help, something happened.‚Äù\n\nI groped around for the phone. I didn‚Äôt even know where it was, but I needed to keep my hands busy. It had to be on the counter somewhere. And that‚Äôs when I heard Jane scream.\n\nShe must have burned herself on the frying pan, or knocked it over, but her shrieks still haunt me to this day. When I did find a phone, I couldn‚Äôt get an ambulance, we couldn‚Äôt even contact the police. A busy line greeted us.\n\nThis didn‚Äôt just happen to us. It happened to everyone. And with the world‚Äôs sight being gone, for some reason sounds we had grown accustom to went away as well. The busy New York City streets were now quiet, the happy chatter that filled the park across from us was silent. We now lived in a blind and muted world.\n\nWe treated Jane‚Äôs burns with ice and carried through the motions of our old life. Before the TV stations went dark, they would bring on people who had suddenly went blind before The Darkness. They said that it was something that they got used to and eventually they learned how to continue living on with their lives. But either they were lying or had a support system that we couldn‚Äôt get because life for us was terrible.\n\nWe ran out of food within a month and began making trips to a near by bodega to pick up whatever we could. When we arrived, people were fighting over the last few frozen meals. We got what we could, but I left with a bruised face and Jane‚Äôs arm was cut by a knife.\n\nWe began venturing further from home to find the things we needed to survive, but a year ago, we got lost and we haven‚Äôt been able to find out way back home. We sleep when we find a soft place, we eat when we find food, and we barely survive.\n\nBut now‚Ä¶ I blinked and there was an outline. I blinked again and there was now faded color. I blinked a third time and saw my wife, hunched over, picking out her ragged hair, and staring at nothing.\n\n‚ÄúJane,‚Äù I said, my eyes still tearing from the sting of the sun, but unwilling to blink again at fear that it would all go away. I stared at her. Her skin was gray and scarred with burns and cuts, her clothes filthy, her bones prominent, and nails long and broken.\n\n‚ÄúJane!‚Äù I said, more loudly this time. She rose her head slowly, her blue eyes looking to the left of me. My voice cracked, I rarely spoke above a whisper in the past few months. There was no need to.\n\n‚ÄúI think I can‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, barely believing it, convinced it was an illusion or a cruel trick. ‚ÄúI think I can‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAnd then something caught my eye. The building behind my haggard wife. Thick black letters formed a sentence. It took me a little time before I understood what it meant as reading had been a lost luxury for us.\n\nDON‚ÄôT TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE!\n\nThat‚Äôs when I began to look around. It wasn‚Äôt just on that one wall, it was everywhere, big and small. Like a crazed graffiti artist had made the city his own but only had one thing to say.\n\nWhose ‚Äúthem‚Äù? I look at the people around me. We were in an alley way accompanied by three other people. A man who looked like he was about to begin urinating and sang softly to himself, a woman napping on a piece of cardboard, and a second man talking softly to the wall.\n\nMy story wasn‚Äôt unique. I had heard many similar ones over the past two years; people who couldn‚Äôt find their families, others like us who couldn‚Äôt find their way home. Some who had gone days without food. There were fights, rapes, theft, murder, and so many horrible things we never thought would happen in our city.\n\nThe world had become lawless. And we were trying to not become its victims.\n\n‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Jane whispered, her head bobbed up to face mine, guided by my voice.\n\n‚ÄúI think I can‚Ä¶‚Äù I looked back at the thick black warning surrounding me and back at my wife. Whoever had written them must have been as crazed as the man who had now begun peeing to the right of me as he sang the alphabet backwards.\n\n‚ÄúI think I can see.‚Äù\n\nI thought the world had gone quiet when The Darkness began, but in the moment I knew what true silence was. The peeing man stopped urinating and singing, the napping woman stopped snoring, and muttering man silenced.\n\nJane‚Äôs face was directly facing mine now. Only her unfocused blue eyes told me that she was still blind.\n\n‚ÄúYou can see?‚Äù She asked, her hoarse voice cracking. She reached out her hand and found my face.\n\n‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I whispered, my tears from the sun now turning into tears of happiness. ‚ÄúI can see. I can see. I can now help us. I can see.‚Äù\n\nShe came closer and put her other hand on my face. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I had missed when Jane cradled my face in her hands, the heat of her palms warming my cheek. She wiped away a tear with her thumb.\n\n‚ÄúI need your eyes,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúI will be your eyes, I will always be your eyes.‚Äù I said. I sniffed back the snot that was beginning to flow from my nose.\n\nHer hands moved from my cheeks next to my eyes. She traced a finger over my eyelid, a broken nail lightly scratching the soft skin.\n\n‚ÄúI need your eyes,‚Äù she said again, this time more loudly. She began to press her fingers lightly around my eye sockets.\n\nThat‚Äôs when movement around me caught my eye. The three other people in the alley with us had risen to their feet and had formed a circle around me and my wife. Panic rose in my chest.\n\n‚ÄúJane, we need to get out of here,‚Äù I whispered, placing my hand on her arm. I went to push her hand off my face, but she tightened her grip. ‚ÄúOuch!‚Äù I gasped, her fingers pressed further into my eyes. ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I pushed her off of me. ‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing?!‚Äù\n\nAnimal like, Jane leaped back at me, pushing me over from my knees onto my back.\n\n‚ÄúI NEED YOU EYES!‚Äù she screamed.\n\nI pushed her off me again, but another hand shot out and grabbed my shoulder. It was the man who seconds ago was peeing next to me.\n\n‚ÄúShe needs your eyes,‚Äù he said as he stared over me.\n\n‚ÄúShe needs your eyes,‚Äù the others began to whisper. ‚ÄúWe need your eyes, I need your eyes, need to get your eyes.‚Äù\n\nAnother hand reached out pinning my other arm, my leg, my torso.\n\n‚ÄúI can help you! I can help all of you!‚Äù I screamed, thrashing and kicking, but their hands wouldn‚Äôt move.\n\nJane peered over me, her face leaned down to meet my own and for a second I thought she was going to kiss me.\n\n‚ÄúBen,‚Äù she whispered, one hand on my cheek, the other stroking my temple. For a second, her blue eyes locked onto my own.\n\n‚ÄúI need your eyes.‚Äù', 'I stilled dreamed of seeing. \n\nI think that\'s why I initially snoozed my alarm clock instead of gasping for joy. But as I rolled back over to look at my wife lying next to me, I did gasp. Not for joy, but out of shock. On the wall behind Kathrine a message had been hastily painted on the wall.\n\n\\-DON\'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE-\n\n""What\'s wrong?"" Katherine said groggily but alarmed. Her vacant stare reminding me that for the last 2 years I have been blind.\n\nI am unable to respond as the realization of what is happening has not fully dawned on me.\n\n""Jim?!"" she now sounds more awake and even more concerned. She flails out her arms searching for me and when her hand rest on my shoulder I have regained enough composure to speak.\n\n""N-nothing."" I stammer. ""Just had a nightmare.""\n\nThe tension in her face eases as her hand glides up to my face and leans in for a kiss.\n\n""you had me worried."" She sighs. ""Do you want to talk about it?""\n\n""No."" I respond quietly, still trying to get my bearings.\n\nI sit up and look around the room growing more confused and horrified as I do. On every available surface I can see the same message has been painted.\n\n\\-DON\'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE-\n\nThe paint is obviously not new, as it has slightly faded from a bright red, to a more rusted maroon. I also see the guide rod we have been using to navigate the new home we were given a year after the great blinding took place. The room looked very different from how I dreamed of it. It seemed smaller and dust has settled on all the surfaces that were not regularly used. As I took in the first glimpses of the room I have spent the last year in, growing more uneasy as I read the same message over and over, I felt a hand on the small of my back. I gave a startled yelp and nearly jumped out of bed.\n\n""Must have been a bad one."" Kathrine giggled from behind me. ""Sure you don\'t want to talk about it?""\n\n""Maybe later."" I mumbled.\n\nI turned to face her and was overcome with emotion. In 2 years she hasn\'t changed much. Her chestnut hair was longer than I remembered it and was haphazardly strewn around her. Her soft smile showed a few more smiles lines around the corners of her mouth. The eyes were the biggest difference. They looked glossed over and unfocused, the rich brown covered with a grayish haze. I felt a pang of sadness and guilt wash over me as I stared at those eyes. The mixture of joy and grief became too much and I excused myself to go to the bathroom.\n\nAs I stood up to leave, I finally noticed the dark amorphous shape in the corner and stopped with my breath caught in my throat. It wavered on the edges as if it were pulsing or breathing. It seemed to be pulling in the light around it further obscuring it from my sight. I reached out to steady myself on the guide rod and as I did, the shaped slithered into the bathroom.\n\n""Hurry up,"" Kathrine complained, ""I need to go too.""', 'It\'s the daydreaming that always gets me. I jolt awake yet the dream keeps playing on the back of my eyelids, making me wonder if I was ever asleep or if I was just thinking. I tilt my face towards the window, feeling the sun\'s warmth and imagining the warm orange glow that comes with it.\n\n""Being on a plane must have been the worst,"" I say, stretching my arms out, aware of the blood flowing through them in a way I never was when I could see. ""One second flying towards wherever, the next totally blind with everyone else, including the pilots.""\n\nI can still hear the passengers screaming in my day dream. I can hear them screaming all the way down.\n\nThe Great Blinding was the darkest - literally - day in human history. Everyone crashed their cars or fell off bridges or starved to death in city parks trying to find the grocery store. Even the animals went blind, and they all died as well. All sorts of terrible shit. Almost everyone died, except those who were already blind and their immediate caretakers, lovers, family members, or whoever else happened to be in close proximity when it all happened.\n\n""Imagine the smell in the factory farms,"" I say out loud, replaying yet another aspect of the Great Blinding back to myself. It\'s how I cope, going over everything that must have happened that day and during the immediate fall-out. ""Imagine all those turkeys suddenly blind and unfed, resorting to ferocious cannibalization before the victors died from a lack of nutrients.""\n\n""Can you quit it just this once, Dan,"" Alice says, sounding run-down and tired. ""You just keep going on and on. I can\'t take it anymore. We\'ve got a food run today.""\n\nHer voice is soft and purpose-filled and I let it fill the room, allowing it to banish my incessant day dreaming. On that fateful day I had been helping Alice cross the street. That one altruistic deed saved my life, for Alice was already blind and for her the Great Blinding represented a minor inconvenience.\n\n""Alright, Alice,"" I reply, standing up and feeling around for my straw hat. ""Hold on a second, one must always look the part these days."" I smile as Alice softly chuckles in the background.\n\nI pick up the straw hat and another form of blindness hits. Objects and shapes and the bright rays of the sun blanketing everything. Sensory overload.\n\n""What the...,"" I say, blinking rapidly. Objects come into focus. My brain re-calibrates its orientation in this world and everything comes flooding back. I see (actually see!) my warn hands holding this warn hat. My eyes are unable to cope and they sting as tears flow freely down my cheeks.\n\n""What is it?"" Alice asks, concerned.\n\n""I can see! Alice, I can-,"" I stop mid-sentence, becoming aware of the words plastered all over the walls, on the table and the chair and the window sill, and even on my hat.\n\n*Don\'t Tell Them You Can See.*\n\n""Tell who...,"" I wonder out loud, the words saturated with growing trepidation. A flash outside the window momentarily blocks the blindingly bright sun. A clamor comes from the front of the house, followed by a rapid scuffling.\n\nAlice folds herself into a corner of the room. ""Oh, Dan... You stupid, stupid man.""\n\n""What are you taking about? What\'s going on?"" The newfound brightness of the room sears my eyes with an intense pain.\n\n""I blinded myself with a hot iron, Dan,"" Alice says sadly. ""I\'m sorry.""\n\nThe clattering grows louder. I take a step towards the corner of the room, to where she is and where safety lies. The door creaks open and something impossible passes through, its sheer presence enveloping the room and me within it. Alice cries out, clamping down hard on her ears.\n\nA thousand voices speak from everywhere at once. ""You let us know. Good bye.""', 'I see walls covered with writings.\n\nI see floors painted with blood.\n\nI see surfaces, chairs, refrigerators and any available surface to draw on plastered with the same damn message.\n\n*""Whatever you do, Don\'t tell them you can see.""*\n\nWhispers of instruction fill my head.\n\n""Hush. Do not speak of your sight.""\n\nI follow blindly, just as I was blind before.\n\nColor, restored. But fear, still dwelling.\n\nI thought a life with color was worth living.\n\nEveryday, I crept onto the scene, acting blindly like I was.\n\nIt was no difference to having sight, than losing it.\n\nDays turn into weeks, weeks turn into months.\n\nSomehow, it has become a chore to maintain such a gift.\n\nTo have sight, but not be able to share it. To gain vision, but not be able to show it.\n\nMonths turn into years. And the day goes on.\n\nBlindness has kept my sanity.\n\nYet, vision has driven me mad.\n\nI look at the table. A pencil on the drawer.\n\n""It\'s enough,"" I say. ""This will do.""\n\nWith force, I stab my left eye, blood gushing onto the scene!\n\nI cry, yet I remain silent.\n\nI see now what the warnings have been. I see now who has written them.\n\nWith my blood, I draw at the table in front of me. A surface large enough for my message.\n\nI need to warn them. I need to tell them what will happen to them.\n\nBefore I lose my sight, I write my one, last message I will witness.\n\n***""Whatever you do, Don\'t tell them you can see.""***', 'It\'s been weeks since I regained my sight.  The messages... the **message** was scrawled everywhere.  In different mediums, different handwriting... always you could see the frantic fear in the strokes of paint or blood or dirt or shit.\n\nWeeks since I felt the joy of regained sight, replaced immediately by ultimate fear.  I didn\'t even know what I was afraid of.  Who ""Them"" were.  But the message was everywhere and you bet your ass I was afraid.\n\nFor weeks I\'ve been pretending to still be blind, going about my \'normal\' life.  I walk most places with my eyes shut, worried about giving myself away... after all, *someone* might see me.  So many messages, it can\'t have been one person who wrote them.  And they can\'t have done it blind.  So -- somewhere out there -- there are sighted people.  And they left a message *for* sighted people.\n\n***So are ""Them"" blind?***\n\nThe realization stops me in my tracks.  Another pedestrian bumps me and immediately goes around without an apology -- collisions are expected in the new world.  \n\n*Written messages would be useless if... whoever-they-are could see them... But then how--*\n\nIn that moment I see a man on a far street corner.  He is leaned against a building, watching me intently.  **Watching me.**  His eyes dart to one side and I glance over to see two men clad in black, wearing silk blindfolds, cutting too-efficiently through the crowd, coming right for me.  The man at the corner slips away.  I feel the fear gripping me anew.', ""It's surprising how quickly you adapt to the dark. At first it was a disaster, people wept and raged and died in droves, but it was barely two years now since the world went blind and these days, things are almost normal again.\n\nNikolai came out with their new self driving cars, fully optimised for their sightless passengers, meanwhile Pear and Congo got together and trained their voice assistants to better help us get around. Honestly, with technology being what it was, the blindness barely made a difference.\n\nStill, sometimes you almost felt like the darkness was bearing down on you, a pressure and oppression that became so constant you barely noticed it was there, like that slight ring in your ears in a quiet room.\n\nThere were fewer people too, I think my office only has 17 employees, including myself. Apparently it had more than a hundred back when the blindness first hit.\n\nI arrived at work today, like most others, and set about navigating my way to the dictation cubicles. Nick, my old friend from high school, bumped into me along the way. He seemed... perturbed, like something had worried him. I questioned, but he just spattered something about work stress and left. He was in such a hurry, he didn't even bother following the guide wires.\n\nIt wasn't until later that day that I saw him again, I was heading for my car when he asked if he could hitch a ride to my place to discuss work. Obviously I didn't mind, these days company was about the best entertainment available since TV and video games mostly faded away with our sight.\n\nWe got home and made our way inside, I could tell Nick was nervous and his anxiety was starting to rub off on me.\n\n>I gotta tell you something\n\nI inquired, but he was hesitant\n\n>Swear you won't tell anyone! Literally. LITERALLY! Nobody.\n\nI agreed, laughing nervously at his insistence.\n\nHe stood up and faced me, before muttering;\n\n>I can see again...\n\nI laughed it off, sure he could, very funny, what colour shirt am I wearing? He didn't seem to think it was funny, and repeated himself.\n\nIt was annoying me now, he was lying, obviously. He couldn't see, nobody could. He kept going on about stupid messages on the wall. There were no messages, he was just attention seeking. All this for a laugh? \n\nHe kept rambling, trying to find ways to prove his lies, I wasn't listening any more. What was wrong with this piece of crap? He came into my house and starts this bullshit?\n\nThe world felt hotter as he ranted, why won't he just shut up about this? What's wrong with him. Shut up Nick. \n\nI found myself breathing faster, the weight of the dark was annoying me, it was like an itchy jumper and Nick just... Kept talking! \n\nI told him to shut it, he asked why I was standing, why I was scowling. How the fuck does he know what my face looks like? What nonsense trick is this?\n\nWhy is the air so fucking heavy!? He can't see nobody can fucking see what the fuck is wrong with him shut up seriously shut the fuck up just get away just fucking stop stop stop fucking stop this I hate it I hate you so fucking much just burn burn in hell hate hate fucking die already\n\nHonestly I barely even notice the blindness anymore. About the only change I've noticed is there seems to be far fewer people. I remember a busy world when I was a kid, but these days my whole office only has myself and 15 other people working there.\n\nStill, it's strange, sometimes, when I wake up of a morning, I swear I see the faintest glimmer of light. I wonder if my vision is starting to come back?"", 'As everything came into focus, red block letters greeted me\n\nDON\'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nFor a moment I sat, looking at the shapes.  Like the others, I had been blinded December before last.  My MX-Sarah assistant had guided me back home while the world was in chaos.  The robot became my eyes.  \n\nI needed an upgrade but Patriot Pay was stalled.  We were the lucky ones.  The ones with skill sets that didn\'t need our eyes.  United States Occupational Relief picked us up.\n\nThere was an uprising, if you can call it that.  Blind masses screamed in the street for something to be done.  Screamed for answers.  For a cure.  But the doctors had been blinded too.\n\nThe e-security cleaned everything up very quickly.  It was rumored they retrained you in the camps for an occupation you could do without your sight.  I liked to believe it.  The more plausible rumors aren\'t vey nice.  \n\nOfficial broadcasting never made mention of the camps.  They were something not to be acknowledged.  Like the blocks of empty houses.  Something to be forgotten.\n\nDON\'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nAfter two years, letters become shapes before words.  When the message finally hit, I closed my eyes reflexively.  My heart started racing.  I had a new secret to keep.\n\n*Marcus, is everything all right?*\n\nMX-Sarah\'s grating, chipper tone stabbed the air.  I rubbed my eyes and replied ""I think it must be a bit dusty, that\'s all"".  I opened my eyes and willed them out of focus.  \n\n*You would like me to dust.  Is that correct?*\n\nA sickening wave self-consciousness hit.\n\n""Yes.  Sarah.  Schedule dusting today.  1500.""\n\n*Dusting scheduled today at 3pm.  To cancel, say CANCEL*\n\nThen there was silence.  I was trying to remember what I did with my body.  My eyes. \n\nBe normal.  Be normal.\n\nDON\'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nNote:  Have to go now.  If someone is interested in finishing this, I\'m thinking over-population for post global warming scarce resources caused a global oligarchy to take dramatic action.  Artificial intelligence has made human workers all but unnecessary.  Mass blinding was a way to exterminate a large portion of the population.  Mass disinformation campaigns / desire to keep people in their place.  Hence, DON\'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nThinking there is are ""The Visionaries"" that paint the letters, subverting the rulers.  I\'m imagining secret transport network + a final boss scene, ambushing the ruling class.  The blindness is caused by an issued chemical.  Just need to avoid exposure.  Some accidentally are ""cured"" because they have accidentally avoided the blindness dose for long enough.\n\nThanks for the great prompt OP!', '**Welcome to the Prompt!** All top-level comments must be a story or poem.

It was a slow seeded plague on humanity; anyone from important leaders to the homeless lost their eyesight suddenly, and what doctors tended to them could not fathom what had happened. Maybe it was mass hysteria. Maybe it was another facet of mental illness. It was waved away as just another illness to cure when there were only a few cases. The  government didn't really care at that time; it wasn't as much of a concern to them as what the president was writing on twitter.\n\nWhen the blindness began to spread, when waves of people were turning up blind in the streets ‚Äì causing panic, unable to see, throwing themselves at cars and businesses and clinging manically to any person they could dig their fingers into ‚Äì they were corralled like animals. People died in throngs then; either by waves of suicide, their rotting corpses stinking up alleys and their homes, or by police brutality. The news pedaled their wares; that those who were ensorcelled by this blindness were driven mad. They couldn't be reasoned with. To keep the public safe, if someone was 'too far gone', the police had to react swiftly and that sometimes meant civilian losses.\n\nThere were protests at first. Once the desperate, untreated blind found their way into the throngs of people screaming outside of the white house and their local police stations, the riots ceased. People were too scared to leave their homes and.. the world changed. As more people fell to the blindness, those unaffected began to agree with the hysteric media. Yes, the blindness was a disease. Who cared where it came from, people were being attacked on the streets! It wasn't safe to leave your house! They were spreading the blindness!\n\nCivilian militias formed and, quietly, using the blindness of the ill against them, they killed the easy ones first. Anyone who didn't struggle was just moments away from a frenzy, by their accounts. Bars would be full on the evenings, covered in barb wire and chicken mesh to keep away the desperate, like homes and schools and anything else that had to be kept safe. Spikes were placed on the ground, tearing up the feet of those without shoes, ruining the shoes of those who had them.\n\nThe blind weren't stupid. Aside from those hit with hysterics and who could barely function on their own when they could see, most of them learned quickly to keep to themselves. Many would claim they were blind before the epidemic hit, working together with those who actually had been and assistive facilities to get home, to get food, whatever they could to survive. This was short lived. It took one year for blindness to take everyone. Shame filled most of the world; those who had been killed in the initial hysterics had monuments built for them. Their names were etched, messily, into large concrete slabs that were painted and polished to be, at least to the touch, acceptable. Once the media organizations learned how in their blind stumbling, apologies were aired over the news. Groups of people came together to apologize to families of the lost. All of the anti-blind measures were removed. The ground was uneven and pocketed where once spike traps and other deterrents lived.\n\nSociety has recovered as much as it can. Doctors can't use their fancy medical equipment as well as they'd like, import and export is difficult when no one can see the state of the ocean to bring goods along. People get by. Society is recovering. We live in a world of blind being lead by the blind, by those who went blind and managed to adjust first.\n\nMy account was supposed to be just that. An account of things as they were; I lived through the worst of it. I was one of the hysteric many that fled into the streets first. I was terrified. Mania was replaced by fight or flight desperation for survival and I survived the first slaughter. I went home, barricaded myself inside, and did everything I could to find resources. It helped.\n\nTime after the Great Blindness took everyone has been.. okay. Lackluster, almost. I spend most of my free time sleeping. My dreams will ebb between old movies I've loved; I can see in my dreams. The knowledge I had once of what everything in the world looks like is still in there somewhere. My waking hours are spent making some money through working misc jobs online; I'd become accustomed to the voice that will read back to me as I type away at my keyboard, double checking my finger placement with the soft braille markings on top. I pause after each paragraph of writing, listening to her recounting it, making sure I've phrased and structured everything alright, that I haven't made a typo anywhere that massively changed a word into some discombobulated semblance of language. Those who have fancy self driving cars use them mostly as expensive food delivery services, and I'm lucky to have the ability to pay for that.\n\nAfter a delivery, mid-step in returning to the kitchen with a load of new groceries, my vision returned."", ""729 days. That‚Äôs how long it‚Äôs been since the Great Blinding, although if you ask me there‚Äôs nothing great about it. What‚Äôs so great about losing your sight? At least I wasn‚Äôt the only one suffering. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in prison when The Great Blinding happened. Whoever was pulling the strings chose the worst possible moment, we were having lunch. You can imagine how that turned out. Those first few moments were madness. Someone screamed, someone got stabbed, someone got shot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nImmediately shit hit the fan I dove under the table. I stayed there until I heard The Voice. It came from everywhere and nowhere at the same time and as soon as we heard it all the commotion died down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe are your guides, sent here to make sure that you do not lose your way now that you have lost your sight. Listen to us or you will be punished. ‚Äú\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt something touch my shoulder and it hasn‚Äôt left my side since. \n\nWe were slaves with a master constantly looking over our shoulder. \n\nWhen I woke up on day 730, I thought it was going to be an ordinary day. I would wake up, do whatever task I‚Äôd been assigned, eat my shitty food and go back to bed. I did not expect to see. \n\nI almost screamed out in joy until I saw what was written on my wall \n\nDon't Tell Them You Can See.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI froze and immediately closed my eyes. That was my first mistake, but at the time I did not know. Thoughts began racing through my mind, who shouldn‚Äôt I tell? Why shouldn‚Äôt I tell them? How did they know that I would one day regain my sight?\n\nUnbidden an old nursery rhyme came to mind\n\nI keep six honest serving-men \n\n(They taught me all I knew); \n\nTheir names are What and Why and When \n\nAnd How and Where and Who.\n\nAt this point I lost it and burst out laughing. I didn‚Äôt let out a belly laugh or a chuckle; I laughed like someone who had lost his mind. \n\nThere‚Äôs something calming about laughing like that. You‚Äôll never understand it until you are standing on the edge of sanity. \n\nI laughed for god knows how long before they came for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey guys please tell me what you think. I'll be uploading part 2 soon"", ""*Don't tell them you can see. Don't... tell them you can see*, I read the words again and again and still I can't make sense of them. Maybe the capitalization has something to do with the importance of the message? *Don't Tell Them You Can See... DTTYCS...* No, that's not it.\n\nIt's been three hours since my eyes began to work. I've panicked twice, puked once, and read the message so many times the words don't look real. The letters don't look real anymore. *Don't tell them you can see*...\n\nSomeone clicks from downstairs in the house, an echoing click following soon after. The noises are accompanied, by the raucous laughter of my brother and his friends. They're probably listening to that podcast they like, the one that told stories from Before.\n\nI make my way from the room, to the bathroom, where I can see how dimly everything is lit. There's no need for light when you can't see. So I make the conscious effort not to reach for the light switch, and instead shut the door, using the little light from the outdoors to light up my face in the mirror. I study it curiously.\n\nI've never seen it before. I was blind before the Blinding occurred."", 'You wake up, and for the first time in years, you feel the pain of bright light on your eyes. *Wait, light?!* you jump out of your bed and close the green curtains on your window.\n\n\'Oh my God. I-I can-"" you immediately stop talking as you look on your wall and see writing in neat, red marker,\n\n""Don\'t tell them you can see. Act like everything is normal. Carry out your day as usual."" Following the strange writing you decide not to shout it to the rooftops like you thought of, but open the door to your bathroom. On the mirror, in the same, neat writing,\n\n""Nothing has changed. Pretend to be blind."" you start to feel uneased, scared if someone is in your apartment. You slowly exit your bathroom, grab some non-safety scissors, and search the kitchen, your small office, and the living room. In each room you see more of the writing, telling you to not change anything in your daily life, to act natural; in every room the writings become more frequent, more aggressive, and more insistent that you should never reveal this recovery to anyone, even the people you trust the most. No one is in your apartment, that for sure, but one thing is certain:\n\nIn the last two years, someone was, and you had no idea.\n\n""DING DONG!"" rings the doorbell, snapping you out of this unnerving thought. You travel to your intercom, and say:\n\n""Who is it?""\n\n""It\'s James, duh!"" Ah, yes. James, your best friend since college and your co-worker at Roy Industries, a company that started in manufacturing, specializing in disability aides such as: canes, hearing aides, wheelchairs, and stair-lifts, and after the Great Blinding, with everyone needing their products, grew into a ginormous cooperation that has a stake in almost every industry; everyone has heard of them, and most rely on Roy In. for their paycheck as well. You work in the admistrative section of the company, and so does John, you often walk to work together, as motor vehicles became too dangerous after The Great Blinding. Sure, it takes a while, but you live in the city, so at least it\'s not too bad of a commute; some people had to quit their jobs or move so they could work after the loss of an entire sense. Luckily, you lived close enough to not have to change your home/job, and so did John.\n\n""You ready to go?"" John asked.\n\n""What? Oh, sure. Let me just get my cane.""\n\nWill write more soon, I just wanted to get the beginning on paper. (or, should I say, computer) Anyway, see you soon!', 'I walk along the street. It\'s a normal night like any other. Nothing special until I see the sun rise. Something was different the light was too bright. Far too bright. I close my eyes and they still burn from the light. I try covering my eyes as they\'re closed yet they\'re still burning. Until I can no longer see the light. \n\nI open my eyes to find darkness. I open my phone and say. Hey Google call 911. I hear cars crashing in the darkness. I get up and run away from the noise. I stumble and fall but I manage to follow the sidewalk home thank the gods I was taking my normal route.\n\n""911 what is your emergency?"" The lady says. She sounds just as scared as I am. ""I can\'t see something blinded me this morning as the sun rose."" She pauses for a second. ""Are you safe? She says."" I find her question strange. ""Yes I managed to find my way back home."" She sighed a bit. ""I\'m blind as well and so are all of our emergency service workers. Just try and turn a radio or TV to a news station and await further instructions. We\'re all working in the dark right now. I don\'t even know how to tell people where to go!"" She begins crying and then regains her composure. ""Stay safe."" she says as she hangs up. \n\nAfter years we manage to adjust and somewhat keep surviving cars aren\'t really a thing anymore. Everyone walks everywhere and cities are mainly abandoned but there\'s a lot of goods to raid from them to trade for food if you can manage it. Everyone\'s hearing has increased significantly. It\'s what we use along with scent to hide from predators mainly packs of wild dogs and occasionally escaped zoo animals. \n\nJust as it seems we\'ll adjust to our blindness. I am hiding from something I\'ve never heard before in a shop. It doesn\'t sound like anything I\'ve ever heard. All of a sudden I\'m blinded again. It\'s like the blinding light from before. I see inside of the walls of the shop. Don\'t let them know you can see. Who were they talking about.\n\nThen as I step outside I see exactly who they\'re refrencing. Floating orbs with what seems like endless tendrils. They are carrying different people away. I go back into the shop and find a pair of thick black shades. I put them on my face and I pick up my walking staff. What in the world happened that day. \n\nThen I hear the ""drones"" that drop food to us. I see a few people come out of hiding. Turns out what we thought were drones were nothing of the sort. They latch there tendrils onto the faces of those nearby. Pumping something into us. Come to think of it the closer I look at them they don\'t look human at all....\n\nI try to walk normally back to the store. It\'s pretty easy to find a mirror since nobody would be raiding those since we\'re all blind. I look into it and my skin is moist with tendrils forming around my mouth. I was too distracted earlier at the return of my site to notice the webbing inbetween my fingers. The scales that were growing on my hand. \n\nI begin to have a headache. My blood feeling as though it\'s boiling. That\'s right I always went to the ""drones"" before this. I go back to them. They latch onto my face and begin pumping sustenance into my body. Then I feel it. They know is all I can think. I rip it from my face and I run to the store where I awakened my site. I don\'t know why. Call it instinct. I break the mirror and write. Stay away from the drones in my black blood. Soon it finds me soon it drags me from the store. \n\nIt takes me into its mouth. I feel myself disappear this isn\'t death. It\'s rebirth. I awaken my eyes are working. I am hiding from something. On the walls of the store I\'m hiding in there are two messages. Don\'t let them know you can see and beware the drones. What does this mean?', '""Oh god,"" is all I can think to myself as I reread the message in front of me. I glance around at the people around me, all of them shuffling around. The sound of canes tapping the concrete ring in my ears as my pulse quickens.\n\n""What am I going to do..."" I mumble under my breath before joining the crowd of people.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of everyday life when you\'re blind has become the norm. I got used to the routine of feeling my way to different locations by relying on my other senses. The shock of waking up and still being in the dark subsided after the first month. But...now that my sight has returned....\n\nA loud crash is heard over the scraping of canes. I instinctively look up towards the sound and before I can stop myself, I\'m staring in the direction the noise came from. A toppled trash can rolls from side to side as people bump past it. A boy stands against the wall where the trash once was makes direct eye contact with me. I gasp and look down and away. I try to keep close to the street, avoiding eye contact with the boy at all costs.\n\nMy efforts are useless, however.\n\nThe boy intercepts me and grabs my wrist, pulling me down an alleyway. I struggle against his grip, but his hold tightens the more I fight. We stop at the end of the alley and he releases my wrist.\n\n""Why did you-""  I begin to say when he shushes me. \n\nI frown and lower my voice to a whisper as he looks at the street.\n\n""Why did you drag me here? Who are you?"" I ask.\n\nHe turns toward me and looks into my eyes. His eyes were piercing, searching mine. He lets out a breath.\n\n""I wanted to see if anyone else regained their sight. Only the people who can\'t see would look up so quickly to the sound of commotion,"" He looks over my shoulder at the street.\n\n""We can\'t stay here. Follow me and try to not call attention to yourself. They have eyes everywhere."" He whispers. ""We\'ll talk more when we are safe.""', 'Edited July 28, 2020\n\nDear YouTube: StoryShuttle stole this story from me. They DO NOT have my permission to use my story as content for their video. Thank you\n\nConsciousness flooded James Bond all at once, but he did not show it. He stayed slack in his chair, eyelids limp, only listening. He sat strapped into the driver\'s seat, hands taped firmly to the steering wheel. They had put him in a thick white space suit that made his forehead prickle in fear-sweat. \n\nHe turned his head toward the mirror. His visor was so dark he could not see his own eyes staring back at him.\n\nBeyond the car he heard nothing but the faint murmur of voices speaking on the other side of the glass. \n\nThe back of his head ached in a slow, pulsing way, but he wasn\'t bleeding. Couldn\'t have been that bad. He could still think. He could still get out of this.\n\nHe always could.\n\nAdrenaline erased the ache in his head, his horror and muted, near-forgotten panic. He knew where he was. Where he had to be.\n\nSomeone knocked at the window to his right. The passenger door rose.\n\nThe agent raised his eyes to see the face of the man he had pursued for weeks: the billionaire inventor who planned to blow up the Earth, once he shepherded all the most cultured and valuable people off of it. \n\n""Musk,"" Bond spat. He sat up, maintaining a defiant air of dignity, despite his raging headache. \n\nElon Musk grinned back at him. He swung open the door. Behind him stood a wall of armed henchmen, their fingers poised over triggers. He waved a dismissive hand to him and relaxed.\n\nMusk relaxed into the car beside him and patted the seat like it was his own child. ""This was one of the earliest ones, you know. The first cars we produced.""\n\nBond stared out the slanted window, steely-eyed and silent. He wriggled the fingers of his left hand out of his bulky glove one by one.\n\n""It\'s a good send-off. Symbolic. People love a good symbol."" He looked Bond over and patted his knee. ""You\'re integral, you see. I couldn\'t have done this without you.""\n\n""Why are you doing this?"" Bond sighed. His breath pearled in little beads of condensation down his visor.\n\n""It\'s simple, Mr. Bond. I very much prefer you dead. And I would prefer to ensure no one can come looking for clues."" \n\nHis left hand came free of the glove. The suit was thick enough that it more or less held its shape as he snaked his arm slowly, tenuously, out of the sleeve of his suit.\n\n""What is it you plan to do, then?"" Bond bit his lip, hard. This was his safest strategy. The best way to steal every spare second he needed.\n\n""I think it\'s rather self-explanatory, Mr. Bond. Your suit""--he rapped Bond\'s helmet with his fist--""has a built-in radio. I\'ve strapped you here to drive my car on its final journey."" He spread his hands upward, and the ceiling panels opened overhead to a sky of smoke and stars. ""You\'ll be my Starman. I\'ll launch you into space. This suit, lovely as it looks, is not as airtight as it could be. It was designed for a dummy, you see. You\'ll have to do, for now.""\n\nBond growled through his teeth, ""Damn it, Musk--""\n\nBut Elon Musk carried on as if he did not hear, ""Don\'t try to hold your breath, Mr. Bond; your lungs will only explode. And the last thing you\'ll hear before shattering through our stratosphere and dying alone in the cold perfect vacuum of space... will be Earth. Cheering as you go.""\n\nHe had his arm bent as far it could go without bulging in the suit. Did not so much as look toward Elon Musk.\n\n""That\'s the plan, then?"" he asked, solemnly.\n\n""It appears so."" Elon Musk smiled up at the stars. ""You\'ll be flying straight to hell at eleven kilometers a second, buddy."" He slapped Bond\'s chest and laughed like they were old friends. ""And we were just getting to know each other.""\n\nBond yanked his arm out of his suit, delved into his jacket pocket for his pen. An innocent little thing, the metal battered and bruised, the ink dry. No one would think to remove it when they patted him down.\n\nMusk laughed. ""It\'s admirable, but don\'t think you can escape, Mister--""\n\nHe never got the chance to finish.\n\nJames Bond depressed the tip of his pen. A burst of red light ate through the hide of his suit and sheared the windshield overhead in two.\n\nMusk staggered backward and shrieked, ""*Shoot* him! Shoot him, you stupid bastards!""\n\nThe men surged forward.\n\nBond leapt out of the spacesuit and bolted like a rabbit out of his seat. He still wore his suit, albeit wrinkled, and his pocket square gone. They had taken his gun, so Bond dove behind the car and raised his pen. Calculated to himself how much mortal damage it could really carry out.\n\nHe smirked. \n\nNow seemed as good a time as any to find out.\n\n***\n\n/r/shoringupfragments \n\nJames Bond *usually* murders everyone in the room with a laser at the end of a movie right?', ""Bond heard the rockets ignite. Strapped into the car, the G-force drove him backwards into the seat, sending his cheeks tearing into his face. His lungs compressed, then almost collapsed, as his entire being shook.\n\nAll the while, he thought he could hear Musk's evil laugh. \n\nHe would not go out like this. \n\n****\n\nThe rockets plunged into space. At his current trajectory, he would forever be stuck in orbit, his corpse withering away in isolation - the perfect crime. Musk would have won, and no one on earth would know that their savior was in fact their doom. Musk had revealed his plans for humanity in true villain fashion - even he could not resist a monologue. \n\nBond knew how helpless his situation was. There were no parachutes, no way to cancel the payload detachment. Though Bond had survived countless missions before, he knew that this was his end. \n\nBut he planned to go out in style. \n\nHe eventually managed to pry his right arm loose from the straps. With that, he switched on the car, accessing the GPS system.\n\nHe knew there was no way of landing safely back on earth... he could only crash. But he could crash with *purpose*.\n\nMusk had let his hubris get the better of him, Bond thought, as he hacked into the GPS system with a small, metallic object - a deceptively simple device, but then again, Musk was a man of simple efficiency. He used the same GPS system on the car as the rockets itself, and it was a simple task of linking the two operating systems together.\n\nHe typed in his destination, pressed 'confirm', and felt the rockets shudder. They used the last of their fuel to divert their course back to earth, then detached themselves soundlessly.\n\nBond kept on telling himself it was for the good of the world. That this was a selfless act. \n\nBut deep down, he tasted revenge. \n\nAs he entered the atmosphere, the car burning up, he stared at the blinking GPS system. His destination was nearing, ever so quickly. \n\nAs he felt his suit set alight, as a magnificent house came into view, he could only hope that Musk was home. \n\n****\n\n[CroatianSpy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/)"", '""What, are you really expecting some sort of villain monologue, where I reveal my evil plan in the most dramatic way possible, allowing you to escape?

Still, he kept cool, smirking slightly.\n\n""Do you really expect me to understand why you\'re doing this, Musk?""\n\n""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die."" Shouldering his flamethrower, the eccentric billionaire exited the cockpit. The door shut with a pneumatic hiss, and the secret agent leaped into action, muscles straining as he popped free of his bonds. He wasted a second ensuring the discreet recorder in his Oxfords was secure before turning his attention to the door. It had never meant to keep someone locked inside. Weight restraints meant that SpaceX hadn\'t done much to reinforce it. Still, Bond couldn\'t get through.\n\nThe radio turned on, a burst of static before Elon\'s voice came through. The gloat was gone, replaced with a twinge of sadness.\n\n""Mr. Bond? If you make it if you do meet up with the mothership, tell my girls I\'ll be home soon.""', 'James struggled to move. His suit had been drilled into the sides of the car, restricting his motion. On top of that, the man had given him a sedative that would relax his muscles while keeping his mind fully aware of the situation he was in. \n\nMillions of people would be watching, yet none of them would know the true horror of the spectacle they were watching. An actual man in that suit? A ridiculous idea. \n\n""You can\'t stop this, Mr. Bond. Once this rocket launches, the final step of my plan will be in full motion.""\n\nJames mentally shook his head as he remembered the subtle stutter Elon had developed to lure his followers into believing he was an innocent man with the best intentions driving his endeavors. No one would suspect the truth. *It was all an elaborate scheme.*\n\n*****\n\nJames heard the countdown and closed his eyes. As the rocket took off, the weight of a million tons crushed him into his seat, and through the deafening roar of the 27 Merlin engines firing, he could hear the seemingly louder, deafening applause that came through the headset Musk had placed in his suit. Bond passed out. \n\n******\n\nWhen he awoke, he thought he was in a dream. He could not move his head, but his eyes darted around in his helmet. He was floating in a vacuum, but as he looked ahead, he teared up at the sight of his planet. It looked so peaceful from up here, far away from the petty squabbles that corrupted its surface. \n\nBut Bond did not feel sorry for himself. He felt sorry for the millions of people who would worship Elon for the next few years. He felt sorry for the millions of people who would count down the days until Musk launched the Mars Transporter.\n\nAnd most of all, he felt sorry for the millions of people who would scream in joy when Musk himself boarded his rocket to Mars, completely unaware of the nuclear weapons he would unleash on Earth once he was gone... \n', ""**Off-Topic Discussion**: All top-level comments must be a story or poem.

Elon took in a deep breath before announcing, ‚ÄúIt is time!‚Äù Elon tapped his watch while moving over towards the control panel surrounded by his employees. \n\n‚ÄúIs this thing working?‚Äù Elon tapped the microphone. The microphone was linked into the spacesuit in which James Bond was trapped inside of. The white spacesuit was locked into position inside of a Tesla Roadster built onto Elon‚Äôs rocket.\n\n‚ÄúOkay, I hope this thing is working now because I must tell you about my plan that is literally out of this world!‚Äù Elon covered the microphone before laughing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what I‚Äôm going to do Mr. Bond.

Let me just say that the last thing you‚Äôll hear before leaving this earth forever, will be everyone‚Äôs applause.‚Äù Elon glanced over towards his employees letting out a good chuckle.\n\nTalulah Riley, a beautifully blonde European woman with green eyes locked onto Elon‚Äôs madness. ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù She insisted, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this!‚Äù\n\nElon snapped his fingers before one of his men grabbed Talulah. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll deal with you later.‚Äù Elon waved the man to escort her out of the hanger. He leaned himself over the controls before pressing the rocket to start initial launch protocol.\n\n‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù Elon remarked. ‚ÄúI will have finally solved the James Bond problem once and for all.‚Äù\n\nElon pressed the ignition on the control panel. His employees tried to insist that he shouldn‚Äôt handle the controls but this was Elon‚Äôs show now. He knew it was he who had to launch James Bond into space personally. \n\nThe thrusters sparked into a bright blue flame before taking off from the ground. Elon cheered as he watched the Tesla holding James within the suit lift up towards the heavens. The rocket darted towards the atmosphere playing Bowie from Elon's controls.\n\nElon took a few seconds of victory before looking over his shoulder at one of his employees holding their hands up in fear. Elon slowly turned around to find James Bond holding a pistol in front of him. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over Elon.‚Äù James frowned.\n\n‚ÄúOver? I just launched the rocket that you were supposed to be on! How did you escape?!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? I was never on the rocket.‚Äù James raised his pistol to eye level.\n\nElon scrunched his brow before scratching his head. ‚ÄúYou were in the spacesuit. How are you no longer in the spacesuit?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI was never in a spacesuit.‚Äù\n\nTalulah barged back into the hanger with a gun given to her by James. Elon quickly glanced over at Talulah holding the gun up towards him. While making her way up the stairs onto the control deck, she glared at Elon.\n\nElon, unarmed, smiled towards James. James rolled his eyes before noticing that Talulah was now aimed down onto him instead of Elon. ‚ÄúYou were supposed to be on that rocket.‚Äù She remarked.\n\n‚ÄúI must say if I had been, you played the part of damsel in distress quite well.‚Äù James replied.\n\nElon motioned her to his side. ‚ÄúAlways loyal to the mission at hand, unlike your cancer in Europe.‚Äù\n\nJames didn‚Äôt lower his weapon.

He slipped one of the boots in the suit off his foot with a good shake, revealing the knife hidden within. He grabbed the knife with his toes, dexterously spun it around and cut away at the straps on his legs. Now that his legs were free, he kicked out the windshield in front of him with his fully booted foot. The glass showered around Bond, and a large shard fell conveniently next to his right hand. He grabbed it with his fingers, and began cutting at the bonds around his hands. With a hefty snap, Bond was free of the straps.

Inside the latch were electronic controls, labeled \'Rocket Override Controls\' Bond quickly mashed the stop button. ""3. 2. 1. Liftoff."" The rocket began to lurch upwards. Applause filled Bonds space helmet. ""Did you really think I would make it so easy to stop the rocket, Mr. Bond?"" *Click*. The radio was silent.

Logically, this is a small price to play for the survival and propagation of humanity.‚Äù Confused by James‚Äô seeming lack of interest, Elon snapped further, ‚ÄúAre you listening Mr. Bond? You and your governments are ensuring the destruction of our plant. I am merely giving us hope. And you know what? The world loves *me* for it.‚Äù \n\nJust as Elon ended his rant, James simply began to laugh. Through his tears of laughter, James began to respond, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all the same aren‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs you! The righteous savior,‚Äù he laughed again and continued, ‚ÄúWhat a load of bollocks.‚Äù \n\nElon stopped, looked at James, and flashed a small closed mouth smile. \n\nJust as James was accustomed to being in difficult situations, Elon had become comfortable with people not understanding his grandiose visions. He jumped down awkwardly from the cat walk and now circled James. As he circled his prey, he began inspecting the restraints and the injection equipment to his left. He then looked up at one of his employees and asked, ‚ÄúI assume the injection is ready?‚Äù The man nodded back to Elon. \n\n‚ÄúOk, James, here is what‚Äôs going to happen. We are going to inject you with a serum. This is a special serum full of nanoparticles to systemically kill you from the inside out.‚Äù Elon looked down at James to see if he was impressed. He could see a bead of sweat forming on Mr. Bond‚Äôs brow. Elon began to chuckle and then said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just kidding! That is far too much work and to be completely honest, a complete waste of time. We‚Äôre just going to inject you with potassium chloride.‚Äù Elon grinned widely and then laughed abruptly. \n\nElton John‚Äôs song ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù started to play loudly in the large room. About seven meters from the table was the Tesla Roadster that James would soon be riding into the great expanse. Before James could struggle, a space suit began to envelope his body from the table. Elon looked on impressed with this touch. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even need to unstrap you to prepare this!‚Äù Elon started to bounce with the beat as he watched his nemesis begin to formulate slight signs of panic. \n\nElon‚Äôs employee went over to the injection apparatuses and began to set all of the parameters on the computer. When he was finished he looked up and asked Elon, ‚ÄúShould I press the button?‚Äù \n\nElon shouted, ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù \n\nHe wiggled more intensely with the beat and said, ‚ÄúI want to do that, it‚Äôs my favorite part!‚Äù \n\nMr. Bond tracked him with his eyes as Elon shimmied closer to the computer. James remained stoic, ready to accept his impending fate. \n‚ÄúAu revoir monsieur Bond!‚Äù Before he could press the button, he stopped and leaned into James, ‚ÄúWait... Can you hear that James? Listen closely. Can you hear it now?‚Äù James gritted his jaw and looked up at Elon. ‚ÄúDo you hear the applause? Do you hear the world applauding the beautiful progress that you are facilitating?‚Äù \n\nElon tiled his head slightly to the left, smiled wider, and pressed the button on the computer. A needle plunged deep into Mr. Bond‚Äôs chest with incredible force. The fluid from the syringe began to empty slowly, and as it emptied, James began to convulse. \nElon stepped away from the table and began to do his best John Travolta impression from the ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù diner scene. He danced his way over to the Tesla Roadster. \n\nElon shouted back to the table where James‚Äô seemingly lifeless body laid, ‚ÄúCome on guys, lets get this done! I have things to do.‚Äù \nA handful of men unstrapped James from the table and began to carry him over to the Roadster. They all struggled trying to move him. One of the men walked over with Mr. Bond‚Äôs helmet in hand. After they completed strapping him into the car, Elon grabbed the helmet from his employee. He placed it over James‚Äôs head carefully. He then twisted the helmet gently until he heard a securing click. Looking on fondly to his work, he slowly kissed the visor of the helmet. After a moment, he moved back and turned on the car‚Äôs radio to blast ‚ÄúSpace Oddity‚Äù, by David Bowie. \n\n‚ÄúMay this be our vessel of progress, may you be our ambassador to the stars, Mr. Bond.‚Äù \n\nAs Elon walked towards the exit, he relished the sheer simplicity of this part of his plan. Just as he exited, James‚Äô eyes flashed open and he was covered in a hot sweat. Ironically enough, the nanoparticles that MI6 had injected did their job. He was just thankful everyone in the room bought his performance of a lifetime. He looked around, and began to assess his escape route. As he did, he could help, but think to himself, *‚ÄúAu revoir Mr. Bond? Is he serious? He‚Äôs seen way too many spy movies.‚Äù*\n\n', 'I hope this is ok. It\'s the first one I\'ve done and was written on mobile so might have a few errors. Feedback is welcome.\n\nIt had been 200 years since Elon Musk had made history by launching his car into space. Since then, society had become much more advance. \n\nThe current ""M"" of MI6 always stopped to look at the wall of lost agents. The legendary James Bond always stuck out, possibly because they had never satisfactorily answered what had happened. As M got to his office, the current 007 stopped flirting with M\'s assistant and greeted her with a respectful ""Ma\'am"".\n\n""007, back from Mars I see. Find anything worthwhile on Space X?""\n\n""No ma\'am. They\'re either as charitable as they seem or extremely good at hiding it. I did find something else of interest though""\n\n007 helped himself to some scotch. Even if it was artificial, it was still good.\n\nM sighed in disapproval as she sat down. ""007, it is 9am. No time for Scotch. And do not tell me you\'re adjusting to Earth time, I know for a fact it is 7am equivalent at the colony on Mars!""\n\n007 downed the glass, and decided not to pour another after some brief eye contact with M. Choose your battles he thought to himself.\n\n""Take a seat and explain this something else of interest. Quickly if you please.""\n\n007 took a seat and a deep breath. ""During my mission I.... Liased with Elon Musk\'s great, great granddaughter. Several times actually. Even once in a rover! But I digress. She mentioned to me that a deep family secret is that Musk was actually a madman and that if his family hadn\'t stopped him, he would have taken over the world. It was only after the launch of the first falcon heavy that he became more benevolent, almost like a completely different person. She stated that in his later years, that he said he was at peace now, that his greatest enemy was far, far away listening to David Bowie. I believe James Bond was in the car Musk launched past Mars two centuries ago."" \n\nM sat in stunned silence. She knew Bond had been at the Space X facility on Earth on the night his name was removed from the list of code names out of respect to an MIA agent. But they had never know what he was investigating, only that he had had a hunch. Could this be true? \n\n""Where would the car be now?"" \n\n""Well out into deep space now. It left our solar system around 150 years ago."" Replied 007. He was calm on the outside, but internally he was excited. He had wanted that code name ever since he had got 00 status. He hadn\'t felt this good even when he\'d stolen the last Aston Martin DB5 on Earth from the transport museum. All M had to do was suggest...\n\n""We should attempt to retrieve the body. Have Q set this up, with the cover story being that it\'s for historical scientific research.""\n\n007 nodded, and almost screamed with victory. He left at once to make arrangements, not even acknowledging M\'s disappointed and slightly flustered secretary.\n\nA few months later, 007 awoke from a standard 8 hour period of sleep on the craft taking him to rendevouz with the space Tesla. While not widely used, faster-than-light travel was possibly, unsurprisingly made so by Space X. He took a crafty swig from his hip flask, worrying that it felt less than half full. Navy dullards didn\'t allow alcohol on board. They were due to meet the car today, and it was all 007 could do to keep his cool exterior in place. \n\n""We\'ve got it Commander!"" Yelled an Ensign to 007. Trust them to use his naval rank. 007 ran forward, letting his facade slip slightly. Through the forward viewport, a small dot could be seen getting closer each second. He grinned in anticipation. Preparations to take the car onboard were made. \n\nTwo agnosing hours later in which the hip flask became more empty, the car was on board. 007 approached it slowly marvelling at the fact that this thing was 200 years old. The paint was destroyed, the metal itself warped and covered in pockmarks. The space suit was in tatters, but amazingly the visor was still in tact. The body was very well preserved by the vacuum of space. 007 reverently removed the helmet, paused for a second, and laughed out loud for sometime. When he had got himself under control, he reached out for a comm unit and contacted M, still chuckling to himself as he looked at the frozen face of Elon Musk.', '""not a great plan, Elon!"" Bond exclaimed. \n\n""yes, but I don\'t like getting blood on my hands. Plus this way, at least your skills would be put to a good use. And we even added a big parachute to the roadster just in case you make it to the Mars alive"". \n \nElon has been waiting for this day for a long time. He knew plenty of agents were on his tail and the boring company made all of their suspicions rise. \n\nBut never in a thousand years he had thought he would actually get to meet real 007.\n\nMusk, Bond and 3 of his henchmen walked in the hanger on 41st floor where the roadster was supposed to be loaded. \n\n\n""2 minute and 30 seconds to launch"" announced the countdown lady. \n\n\n""strap him in nicely."" Elon ordered as James kept struggling to get free. \n\nAs they brought out the tesla, Bond was forced to sit in the passenger seat. But he felt something in his hand as he sat down. \n\n""Stay here and make sure he doesn\'t get out."" Musk ordered as he was about to leave the hanger. \n\nHe teasingly said "" Enjoy your ride 007. This just might turn out to be the ride of your lifetime"". \n\n""Not today"" Bond smirked as he jumped out of his seat and punched Elon. \n\nThe other two henchmen didn\'t have time to react as one of them turned around and took them out too. \n\n"" Always good to see you 007"" said the henchmen as Bond dragged Elon and threw him in the boot space. \n\n""I had it under control!"" Bond said. \n\n""I\'m sure you did."" replied the henchman sarcastically while taking off his mask. \n\n""Alright, what\'s the plan, Ethan?"" \n\n""Get in the Tesla, we\'re going for a ride"". ', 'As the rocket rose, Bond struggled against his restraints, crrushed into his seat by the enormous force of the Falcon Heavy. With an incredible effort, the  chin of his helmet inched towards the laser tie pin Q had equipped him with for this very purpose.\n\nIt connected, and an intense beam of light seared through the racesuit. Wincing in pain at the laser searing his flesh, he used his chin to run the beam over his restraints, freeing his arm. He reached for the dashboard..\n\nA great jolt slammed Bonds head forward. Reeling, he registered the booster separation just long enough to avoid blacking out. His arm rose and punched the central screen with its cruel DONT PANIC message. What appeared was a very different pair of words. Aston Martin.\n\nThe internal cameras saw the Tesla shimmer and warp as the repurposed cloaking system of the Aston Martin Vantage revealed the true nature of the vehicle. Wires shot out, taking over the core booster\'s control system and self destruct.\n\nThe rocket spun round under Bonds control, crushing him against the side of the vehicle. As it began to change course, he set the destination as Musk\'s luxurious mansion/Galactic Command Centre.\n\nBond punched the button to release the payload fairing, wondering how he would ever explain this to Q.\n\nThe car  radio crackeled to life. Musk. ""Bond you FOOL! What are you doing. Do you think this will stop ME! MARS IS MINE! MIN....""\n\n""You know the difference between your car and mine, Mr Musk?""\n\nWHA....\n\nHe flipped the cover of the ejection seat/martini dispenser. ""MINE\'S SELF DRIVING!""\n\nAs a fireball grew in the distance, Bond sipped his martini, knowing that the only thing breaking the sky of this perfect day was a parachute bearing the symbol of Her Majesties Government.\n\n', '""Tell me, Mr. Bond - have you ever had your fortune told?""\n\n""No, Mr. Musk - I prefer to make my own fortunes.""\n\n""Then you may not have encountered the Sulk Omen before. Allow me to enlighten you.""\n\nElon Musk took a single card from his breast pocket and placed it face down on the table in front of Bond. He motioned for Bond to flip the card over. Bond did so, revealing a hideous, skeletal character. There was something familiar about the pointed cheekbones and wide, grinning mouth, but he couldn\'t quite put his finger on it.\n\n""Bit of an unsightly chap, isn\'t he?""\n\n""The Sulk Omen, Mr. Bond, is what some might call a God amongst men. He shows up throughout history, if you look hard enough, wherever there is human suffering, woe, and calamity.""\n\n""Mr. Musk, if you\'re going to kill me, I\'d appreciate if you\'d get on with it.""\n\n""Oh, I\'m getting to that. In Ancient Egypt, they told tales of a spectral creature called Skelumon, who once crouched at the banks of the Nile and drank it dry, causing a seven year famine. After the Crusades, the surviving Moors spoke of a savage character named Monk Ules, infamous for drenching his victims in caustic holy water. And you will have heard of Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. But it\'s a well-guarded secret that all of his ideas came from the contributions of a mysterious lab assistant, Ms. Lo Nuke.""\n\n""Forgive me, Mr. Musk, but how do the antics of a mythical, time-traveling lunatic affect our current situation?""\n\n""Think, Mr. Bond. If there\'s one characteristic that defines humans, it\'s shortsightedness. The Sulk Omen has gained a reputation for suffering, but this is only because you are incapable of seeing the complete chain of events. Human beings are wonderful progenitors of ideas, but they\'re awful judges of consequence. You see an atomic bomb and think death and destruction; I see an end to a seemingly insurmountable conflict. You see the Black Death and think of endless misery; I see an effective solution to overpopulation.\n\nIs this making more sense, now, Mr. Bond? I know your organization sent you here to thwart my company\'s progress. I know they would rather I use my research to save this world, rather than take a select few to colonize another. And I could - yes, I could apply my terraforming technology to extract the carbon from the Earth\'s atmosphere. Buy the population another few hundred years, perhaps.\n\nBut I choose not to. Human beings are a cancer upon their homeland. A parasite. A pest. Your world is a sinking ship. I am in a position to save it, but instead I choose to forsake it, for the greater good of your species.\n\nSometimes, however painful it may be, a fresh start is necessary. This is no different from before. Throughout history, there have been times when the course of humanity has needed a little...""\n\n Elon paused for effect.\n\n""*Rearranging*.""', '‚ÄúKolekian, shaken, not stirred,‚Äù declared a dapperly dressed man. \n\n‚ÄúWith haste, sir,‚Äù replied a pink cloud of gas that glowed neon with each vocalisation. \n\nTaking a seat, Bond swirled his index finger on the surface of the table conjuring up a menu visible only to him, courtesy of the specially coded visual augmentation devices embedded around his corneas. A brief containing his new mission filtered into view. Supplied with his kolekian, Bond contemplated the details of his orders, committing the contents to memory as he‚Äôd always been in the practise of doing. Earth and it‚Äôs platter of hodgepodge governments, squabbling over the resources of a single planet were but a distant memory. Here, there were galactic territories to consider. \n\nPolishing off the last of his kolekian, Bond made his way towards the the chrome portal in the middle of the floor and gestures lightly with a sweep of his hand. The portal opened and Bond stepped into it, landing softly in the leather interior of his Lupien 82. Detecting His return, the ship began to hum with energy. ‚ÄúJames, darling, is that you?‚Äù Came a voice from the back of the vessel. \n\n‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm back. New mission it seems,‚Äù replied Bond. \n\nA scantily clad figure appeared from the shadows, ‚Äúsurely you have time for some pleasure before you embark on business.‚Äù\n\nConsidering her, Bond cocker an eyebrow and concluded, ‚Äúwhy, so I do.‚Äù\n\nMany things had changed for Bond over the past two years since his ejection from Earth, but one thing had always remained the same: there would always be females, human or otherwise. ', 'Elon laughed heartily.  His plans had come to fruition.  But there was, as that psycho Jobs used to like to say, ""One more thing.""    \n    \n""One more thing, James. Do you remember Cypress Creek?  Your little victory there?  I shaved.  I dyed my hair.  Changed my face a bit.  Assumed this Musk guy\'s life.  But now Hank Scorpio TRIUMPHS!""', 'Bond stared out at the curvature of the horizon.  He would have to thank Musk for making the space suit functional, his final moments would pass in blissful contentment.  Bond‚Äôs death would be of little consequence, he reasoned.  The data proving Musk‚Äôs nefarious intentions was already on a drone reprogramed to fly to the SIS Building.  He was sure Q would be able to make sense of it all and blow the conspiracy wide open.  So Bond just sat, enjoying the overview effect so often discussed by astronauts.\n\nA blinking red light caught his attention.  Not on the car or the blue orb before him, but out in the black, slowly drifting towards him.  He watched as the red light became a beacon, the small jumble of electronics and solar panelling became gargantuan.  He stared at it absently, until he noticed the short bursts of liquid fuel coming from the satellite.  This was not a chance encounter, the craft was coming towards him on purpose.\n\nBond fumbled with the seatbelt.  He had been unconscious for the trip into orbit, Mr. Musk had not seen it necessary to make the restraints difficult to remove.  He unclipped the last restraint then had to lunge for the strap again as he immediately began to float out of the car.  Grasping his lifeline, he shifted his focus back towards the satellite.  It had synchronized its orbit with the car and now seemed to hover just above him.  James wondered if Musk‚Äôs lust for revenge was so great that he might want a front row seat for his eventual asphyxiation, but now that the probe was stationary, Bond noticed the red light was not merely blinking; it was following a pattern.\n\n.... . .-. . / - --- / .... . .-.. .--. --..-- / .--- .- -- . ... / -....- --.-\n\n‚ÄúYou cheeky devil!‚Äù Bond exclaimed, letting go of his hold for a second.  He immediately regretted the outburst, barely just getting a hold of the windshield before he floated into the ether.  He looked back towards the light, the pattern had changed.\n\n.- ..- -.. .. --- / --- -. / -... .- -.-. -.- .-.-.- / -.-- . .-.. .-.. --- .-- / .--. .- -. . .-..\n\nBond steeled himself.  He looked at the twenty meters between the car and the satellite, it might as well have been miles.  He looked at the car.  Cherry red, black interior.  It was beautiful, he supposed; but it was no Aston Martin.  He pushed off.  He may have overdone it a bit.  He immediately saw that he was moving quite quickly towards the MI6 spy satellite.  He quickly gauged his point of contact and looked for hand holds.  A few antennas and latches seemed promising, he‚Äôd have to put his faith in an evil genius‚Äôs suit design and his own strength.  His knee hit first, slamming hard into a solar panel, cracking it.  His hand found a rung of an engineering ladder, he slipped his arm into it to the wrist, not trusting his grip.  He bounced back hard, his right arm the only point of contact to the satellite, but he held.  Slowly drifting back towards his new ship, he took one last look at his roadster.  A testament to human engineering floating  lazily in front of the vastness of the Earth.  He pitied the loss of such a great mind, wondering why such potential sometimes came with such a lust for control and destruction.  He shook of his reverie and began climbing, hand over hand, towards the back of the back of his ride.\n\nThe panel was easy to find, marked with yellow and black stripes, it read, ‚ÄúINTERNAL DIAGNOSTIC FEED‚Äù, in bold letters.  Again, Bond thanked the man who ultimately put him in this mess for his excellent design as his gloved fingers easily maneuvered the panel open.  Inside, a cord slowly billowed out of the panel.  On one end, it plugged into the satellite.  The other was a standard 3.5mm jack ready to go into any audio equipment from the past forty years.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt beat simplicity, I guess.‚Äù Bond mused.  He had a brief moment of panic wondering where he‚Äôd be able to plug the cord in.  In his flailing, he noticed the systems panel on his right wrist, complete with audio jack port.  These space guys really knew their stuff, he thought.\n\nJames plugged the cord in.\n\n‚ÄúBond.  MI6 to James Bond, copy.  Speak as normal.  MI6 to James Bond. Speak as Normal.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMI6 this is Bond.‚Äù  There was a pause, then cheers.  The voice was Q‚Äôs, but he must have been in some sort of mission control room.\n\n‚ÄúHello Mr. Bond! How are you doing up there?‚Äù The cheers were being muffled, Q‚Äôs voice was shaky.\n\n‚ÄúA little lightheaded, but alright other than that.  Had a bit of car trouble, might need a jump.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúExcellent to hear.  We‚Äôve got what you need, we hope. Three feet to the left of the panel is a safety strap, we need you to click in and confirm.‚Äù  James looked to the left and saw nothing, he looked all around until he found a panel about three feet up.  The harness was equally easy to deploy, he found a loop on his suit and attached himself to the satellite.\n\n‚ÄúI am secured.  Quick note, perspective is a little strange up here, left and right might not due.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUnderstood.  Hold on tight, you‚Äôve got a date with a resupply shuttle.‚Äù  As Bond tried to wrap his head around what Q said, the strap went tight.  James would have expected some warning, some noise, to let him know that they had fired thrusters; but of course, this was space, the liquid fuel merely made a slight cloud and moved the satellite onto a new trajectory.  He was headed towards some supply shuttle they had on an intercept course.\n\n‚ÄúQ‚Ä¶how?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe received your little package.  US forces are already moving to intercept Musk.  We weren‚Äôt sure where you were, but we knew that you wouldn‚Äôt send a drone with that sort of material unless you couldn‚Äôt get out yourself.  I went to school with Elon, he always was a showman.  I figured he wouldn‚Äôt miss an opportunity to make a grand show of getting rid of the biggest thorn in his side.  I knew you‚Äôd be on that rocket and when I saw the car‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd the satellite?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat was easy, all these EUSA types seem to think driving a satellite is business, but I play video games with my son every night, he could‚Äôve gotten to you in half the time.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell get him on payroll then, I‚Äôm getting queasy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight away, sir.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúQ, what about Margarita?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMs. Meyer has been taken into custody, James.  But she‚Äôs safe.  You really know how to pick them.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThank you Q.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get you back floating in tin can shortly, Mr Bond.‚Äù\n\nJames turned back towards the Earth, intent on enjoying the ride.', '""Mr. Bond?! I\'m the President! I\'m President Trump!"" screamed an angry, obese man as he was being dragged down a hallway.\n\n""I know. But I always thought it would be cool to say that,"" replied Elon Must in a snide yet humorous tone. \n\nElon Musk continued walking down the hallway to the control room in the opposite direction. He couldn\'t wait to make the announcement to the world. \n\nHow did we get here? Well, by now we all know we didn\'t just arrive at this moment overnight. Elon Musk was never known to be particularly vindictive or violent, but that Twitter war started by Donald ""Cadet bonespurs"" - oops, J. - Trump was pushed him over the edge. \n\nOpinion polls started to cover the public feud months ago, just as it seemed the Russia investigation was ready to charge Trump. By then, it had already heated up and had the public\'s attention. People were already on the street mobilized, protesting the ""President"" after he found a way to fire Mueller and stop the probe. Maybe Cadet Bonespurs (finally, a nickname stuck, thanks to Senator Duckworth) thought another fight on social media would draw press and conversation away from what he had done if he escalated the altercation with Elon. Nobody really knows what goes through the mind of a madman, though. \n\nWhen the marches started, fivethirtyeight.com had opinion polls tracking his approval rate at 23% and his disapproval rate at 73%. The numbers for the Trump-Elon bout were worse. And they continued to tank every day until this moment. Headlines were entirely in Elon\'s favor with titles such as ""Musk Defends All Africans, Black and While Trump Pro-Apartheid Comments Ignite Rocket Fuel"" - and they were becoming daily, when they weren\'t focused on impeachment or the Mueller firing. Americans were angry, apart from his racist base. \n\nMusk thought about everything Trump had done and said that led to this decision, to kidnap Trump and launch him into space on a one-way trip. He thought about the possible consequences and reactions over the past month as he customized this latest Space X rocket, fitted with 4k HD screens that would broadcast every second in every angle pre- during and post-launch. He was every bit as calculating as he had been and knew he was right, the last thing Cadet Bonespurs would ever hear would be applause from Earth.\n\nA smile crossed his face. He had relaxed while reliving these thoughts over the past 45 minutes while final preparations were made. The military, FBI and all other federal agencies didn\'t even attempt to breach Space X\'s property. Now he was ready to push the button. \n\nHe opened communications with Cadet Bonespurs one more time, ""Hey, make sure you wave to our employees on the moon and Mars when you pass by! Yes, they\'re already there. At least you got one thing right, but nobody will ever know!"" \n\nThis last remark sent Trump into a rage. But he was trapped. Opening broadcast communications required a hand size of at least 7.44 inches to be scanned. Alas, nobody could hear his screams. But he knew it was true! He knew it was a conspiracy! \n\nExcept, it wasn\'t. It was just Elon Musk once again outmaneuvering Trump\'s tiny brain and tiny hands. He knew Trump would believe anything at this point. \n\nIt took Elon another minute to contain himself and stop laughing. Tears welled up in his eyes as he watched the Cadet. Then he pushed the button. \n\n""We have liftoff,"" messaged the control tower. All Trump could hear were cheers and applause.', 'Bond turns to Musk and asks, ""Will you be playing Bowie?"" to which Musk replies ""Yes, it\'s all part of the plan..""\n\nBond looks straight ahead, eyes glistening, a wry smile across his face.. ""Sweet"" he said to himself softly, as the rocket powered toward space.', 'James Bond stared at the billionaire towering over him. \n""Bezos?"", he said. ""It\'s you? You\'re the one who planted the bomb in the VAB?""\n\nThe bald man tilted his head and laughed manically.\n""I didn\'t think it would take you so long to figure it out, Mr. Bond. With the VAB destroyed, NASA will never build its SLS. And after tonight, SpaceX will never launch another rocket again, and I will become the sole provider of super-heavy launches in the world!""\n\nBezos looked up at the Moon, which was conveniently framed in the building\'s skylight.\n""When the fairings of the Falcon Heavy open, the world will see you, dying and gasping for breath. They will see an astronaut die on live television, on Elon\'s car launched with Elon\'s rocket. Musk will be charged with murder, and you won\'t be alive to testify at his trial and tell them the truth.""\n\nThe mad tycoon clenched his fist.\n""Tonight, Elon Musk falls from his throne. The people will see their god for what he truly is - a killer. His empire will fall, and Mars, the Moon, the entire Solar System - all of it will be mine!""\n\n', 'It was the first time he didn\'t know what to do. Elon thought of everything.\n\n\n-Two Days Prior-\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ""007, I have a mission for you. It shouldn\'t be too hard for you, being who you are,"" M said to Bond. ""With us by your side, we can show the world what Musk is really up to.""\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ""Alright, I\'ll take the mission."" Bond said to her. ""I\'ve faced much worse in my day, he can\'t be worse than what I\'ve already faced."" He went to Q to get his new toys.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Once at Q\'s lab, Bond asked him to show him what he\'ll be using.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ""Well, you can\'t get through his house without this radiation dampener. It makes it so nothing can see you through any spectrum of light or radiation. The only downside is that once you put it on, we can\'t contact you, or see where you are. Be careful with this. Another one is this laser pen, a classic. It\'s laser is invisible to the naked eye, making it harder to detect. But of course, if those fail, you\'ll have a miniature EMP, designed to affect an area of 2 square miles, enough to take out his whole house at once. And once you do that, you\'ll have guns built into your suit to defend yourself and take out Elon, only if necessary. Keep him alive.""\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Bond asked, ""When will I be leaving?""\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Q responded,""In about 45 minutes, enough to get through London traffic at this hour.""\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Bond got to Heathrow, and got on a non-stop private flight to San Francisco.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 On the way, he went over the plan again. He would sneak through the back window on the 2nd floor to get in, turn on the radiation dampener, then proceed to Musk\'s back room, containing plans for world obliteration. He would get through with the laser pen, and grab the plans. After that, he would get out. Simple as that.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Once he got to Elon\'s house, he got in without any issues. But that\'s where the plan fell apart. He put on the dampener, but it failed to turn on. He tried again, but to no avail. Out of the inky black, came a familiar voice; it\'s owner quite well known. ""I\'m surprised you would come at this time of night, Mr. Bond. I was about to go to bed, too. Well, no matter. This will only take a couple minutes,"" Musk said to Bond, with a wry grin on his face. Bond pulled out his laser pen, but that didn\'t work either. ""You see, Mr. Bond, I expected you\'d bring your toys, so I brought mine. I put a small electric field where I knew you\'d come in, that would permanently fry all of your gadgets. I also brought my flamethrower, in case you tried fighting back. But I don\'t think that\'s going to happen.‚Äù Bond felt a blow on the back of his head, and fell unconscious.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 He woke up, not knowing where he was, but he felt as if gravity was tilted just a little. He opened his eyes, only to see the inside of a red car, a Tesla Roadster, that was inside a circular building. ""Of course"" thought Bond. But it got worse. He looked down, and saw that he was in a spacesuit. He immediately realized what was actually happening. But before he could think on how to escape, Elon stepped beside him. ""Well, good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I hope you had a good flight here. We had to get you all the way to Cape Canaveral, after all."" Bond looked for anything on him, but couldn\'t come up with something. Elon noticed this, and said ""You can\'t get out of there, Bond. I made sure we got rid of everything that you had, to make sure you wouldn\'t escape, including those guns on your cufflinks. I also added some reinforcement to the suit, so you couldn\'t break it apart. The last thing you\'ll ever hear is David Bowie\'s Starman, mixed with the cheers of millions, cheering for your demise. Have a safe flight!"" Elon walked out of the room, at which point Bond realized what was about to happen. But by then, it was already too late. The rocket was going up in just 4 minutes. He tried, but he knew this was the end of the line. ""He thought of everything,"" Bond whispered to himself.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The rocket blasted off. Bond was thrust into the back of his seat. He knew he had to act now. He got out of the car, and strapped himself to the walls. He knew they would fall apart from the first stage in a few minutes. Sure enough, he was right. And there was one thing that Musk forgot about: his radio. He sent a message to MI6 asking them to pick him up. He then fell into the darkness of unconsciousness.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When he woke up, everything was a blur. He didn\'t know who had him, but he swore that in all of the chaos of him being picked up from the ocean, he could see Musk\'s face.', 'If I shared anything with my reincarnations, it was in our belief in fate. Though each previous version of me held a very different perspective of it. The me that had died in the Great Depression thought it a terrible thing, wicked and omnipotent. The me that had lived as king in the middle ages thought it a gift presented by God. Me, I believed it a promise.\n\nMy next reincarnation was a baby with deep blue eyes and pink skin named George. He started his life alone. George cried so much that they had to put him in a separate room, devoid of the other infants. A nurse checked in on him every few hours. Nobody blamed her. She had more pressing matters to attend to, such as George‚Äôs mother, whose heart rate was steadily growing out of control and her breathing stuttered.\n\nWhen the young lady died, she did so whispering her son‚Äôs name. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she ever even got a look at him. In that hospital room, with the flat-line beep of a heart rate monitor, the nurse checking on George stood, lips quivering and fists clenched. \n\nIn this world, children were supposed to be loved by their parents. If not the mother, who else would? For George, it was nobody, not even himself.\n\nThe orphanage boasted posters of smiling blonde-haired boys and girls with deep blue eyes. George could‚Äôve been a literal poster boy if he ever smiled. But no matter how many stuffed animals they threw his way, how many hugs and smiles they offered him, they could never get those lip-locked edges to curve up.\n\nBy the time he had hit thirteen, he had already smoked his first cigarette and drank his first beer. Nobody wanted to tell him, but everybody knew. Nobody adopted teenagers. He would be a lifer, an unwanted child turned into an unwanted adult.\n\nAnd on his seventeenth birthday, he bought a gun.\n\nNone of us watching were worried at all for other people. Despite everything that happened, George was a gentle boy and that was his problem. Nobody could reach him through his overpowering politeness. It took a mother‚Äôs love to chip away at the boy and all he had was an old photo of a ghost who once loved him.\n\nHe snuck out when the moon had hit its apex, left all the money he had in a small package with a letter. It read: *Thanks for taking care of me.* And that was it. He didn‚Äôt sign it, didn‚Äôt address it to anyone, he wrote it all in a cheap pen and stuffed it inside with twelve-hundred dollars cash.\n\nThe spot he chose was out of the way. Nobody was nearby to be disturbed. No runners would come this way to be scared. The only selfishness he allowed himself was that it was by a river, a black canvas of glittering moonlight.\n\n‚ÄúI was never meant to live,‚Äù he told himself and us. ‚ÄúThis is fate.‚Äù\n\nSome of us nodded with him. Others shook their heads. I stared, my neck stiff, eyes unblinking as he put the gun to his temple.\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it.‚Äù\n\nSome of us, the more boisterous ones, cheered along, egging the boy to pull the trigger. They had seen a thousand lives and would see a thousand more until all of mankind vanished. A single life in a single point of time meant nothing to them. But for me, this was my first.\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said and stood from my seat. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù\n\nThe screen flickered to the tremble of his finger. Soon, it would go completely black. He would fulfill his fate.\n\n‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt how it should go!‚Äù\n\nThe boisterous ones were no longer laughing. The others around me turned away their eyes. At one point in time, they had all been me. They had thought that life mattered, that our pain had meaning. But after a thousand shows of a thousand lives, most of them only slept through the show.\n\nI clenched my fists, the words swelling in my lungs. Then, I took the breath to give them life and I prayed, that somehow, I wasn‚Äôt just a dead man with a loud mouth.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pull,‚Äù I yelled, tears pouring down my cheeks and snot from my nose. ‚ÄúNot until you have a chance. Maybe you never will, maybe this will be how it always is, maybe I‚Äôm wrong about everything, but there‚Äôs meaning in your pain! I can‚Äôt tell you if I‚Äôm right or if I‚Äôm certain.‚Äù My voice dropped low. ‚ÄúI can only promise.‚Äù\n\nGeorge closed his eyes. He hadn‚Äôt heard me, of course he wouldn‚Äôt.\n\nI held my breath.\n\nThen, George broke down, the gun still pressed to his head. ‚ÄúSo cruel,‚Äù he whispered to nobody. ‚ÄúAfter all this, all I have is a promise. That‚Äôs all my fate has to offer.‚Äù\n\nMy eyes went wide. My jaw dropped. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs enough,‚Äù I said, my voice too low even for myself to hear.\n\nThere, George stood, the gun rigid in his hand. And when his tears fell, so too did his gun.\n\n---\n\nHappy Thanksgiving. /r/jraywang.\n\n\n', 'Once, I had travelled with my schoolmates to the Royal Albert Hall in London. It struck me then as cavernous, almost as if the architect had taken a traditional gladiator‚Äôs arena, slapped a dome over it, then filled it with a winding domino-string of seats in concentric circles. Four storeys of seats, all tilted slightly to face the stage, easily four, five thousand people sitting enraptured by the musical landscapes evoked by the symphony. \n\nThis theatre I was now in, was easily five, six times that size. I couldn‚Äôt be sure, actually, because there were no edges which I could perceive without my vision starting to swim.\n\n‚ÄúWelcome, welcome!‚Äù boomed a voice from the stage. The spotlights swivelled to where I was standing, bathing me in golden luminance. ‚ÄúA warm welcome for Gerry Hanley, please! As you all have seen, he lived a long and fruitful life, yielding in the end only to old age! A peaceful end, if you will!‚Äù\n\nI didn‚Äôt know how to react to the entire audience suddenly rising to their feet, clapping as one for me. I was a schoolteacher in my life. I was used to combative classrooms, and certainly not once had my students ever thought to shower such appreciation for me. I waved weakly in response.\n\n‚ÄúAnd now for the results‚Ä¶ Gerry Hanley will be going to‚Ä¶ Team Blue!‚Äù\n\nThe groans from half the theatre were drowned out only by the rapturous cheers from the rest. Confetti spilled from the rafters, and I found myself being led down from the stage and along the aisles. Along the way, other apparent team members stretched out their hands, and I high-fived as many as I could. I collapsed into my seat, and finally the spotlights deserted me. I soaked in the relative darkness for a while, glad the attention was off me. Perhaps I could now gain some measure of my bearings.\n\nA single chime rung out through the theatre, deep and sonorous. Some people got up to leave, while others stayed in their seats, chatting with their neighbours. The giant screen on the stage lit up with the words: ‚ÄúIntermission ‚Äì Five Minutes‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúYou want to grab a drink or something? Next one‚Äôs a bit heavy, a soldier in the Russian army, it seems. Might be good to stretch your legs first.‚Äù\n\nThe speaker was the lady on my right. She wore her dark hair in a tidy bob, and was clad in a sensible evening gown. Habit prodded me to introduce myself and to ask for her name, and we shook hands.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are we going to watch?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúThe life of one Petyr Ivanov,‚Äù Beth said. ‚ÄúThe same way we just watched your life unfold, from the very first breath to the last.‚Äù She laughed at my reaction, then said, ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt be a prude. There was nothing in your life that we hadn‚Äôt seen countless times before.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd when‚Ä¶ this Petyr has lived out his life, will he come here too? The way I did?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Beth said. ‚ÄúThe same for me, and for everyone else here too. We‚Äôve all been here a long, long time.‚Äù\n\nMy eyes drifted to the pamphlet I had found in my seat. At the top, I saw Petyr‚Äôs name, but it was the subsequent part of the title which intrigued me.\n\n‚ÄúIt says ‚ÄòReincarnation 23,274,899‚Äô here‚Ä¶ are we all the same person, just in different lifetimes?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúSo are there other theatres out there, for different people?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot quite,‚Äù Beth said. ‚ÄúI mean, you‚Äôre right that everyone here is technically the same soul who took turns living on earth, but there are no other theatres. This is it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so special about us that only we get reincarnated? I mean, there are so many other peo-‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOh, oh, you misunderstand!‚Äù Beth laughed. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one soul. One human soul. It‚Äôs just been split, or copied, I don‚Äôt know the term, but it‚Äôs the same soul in every living person on earth.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ Just different physical vessels then?‚Äù I said, turning the possibilities over in my mind. ‚ÄúDifferent circumstances of birth, different living conditions‚Ä¶ but everyone has the exact same soul?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Beth said. ‚ÄúYou catch on quick.‚Äù\n\nI was quiet for a while. The seconds ticked off the timer on the screen, and the lights began to dim. People streamed back in, holding little bags of what I assumed to be snacks.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this Team Blue thing they assigned me to?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone makes choices, see. No one here has ever seen the rules themselves. But we‚Äôve watched enough to, if you will, kind of guess which Team someone will end up in, based on what they did on earth. You‚Äôre one of the ‚Äògood‚Äô ones. Morals are hard to pin down, every society‚Äôs got their own interpretations, so it always keeps us on our toes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI suppose those people are in Team Red then?‚Äù I said, pointing to the other half of the theatre. Beth nodded. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the point of it all then? What happens when we finally finish watching the lives of everyone on earth? What happens when one Team outnumbers the other?‚Äù\n\nBeth smiled. Hidden projectors whirred to life, and the screen flickered with images of a baby boy, being handed over from a midwife to his mother. The audience clapped, and sporadic shouts of ‚ÄúGo Team Blue!‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo Team Red proud‚Äù emanated from various pockets of the crowd. \n\n‚ÄúI suppose then there will be a final reckoning,‚Äù Beth said.\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny', 'It had already been explained to me by the closest incarnation to me; I was dead. He told me to keep quiet during the movie, but at first I didn‚Äôt understand. I just dumbly ask how I died. I saw him, well me, try to subdue a laugh as it was explained to me how they‚Äôd all watched me choke out on the tiny chicken bone I‚Äôd managed to get lodged in my throat. Apparently it was amongst the top 5 worst ways some version of me had left the world yet. The strange thought occurred to me to sue the company who packaged the chicken strips, before I realised I‚Äôd never be earning any money again whatsoever.\n\nNot just that. I‚Äôd never see mom, Eric, anyone. My mind felt numb at the thought; it wasn‚Äôt something that I could wrap my head round. I‚Äôd never sit in traffic again. Never open my presents at Christmas. Never enjoy the bitter sweet smell of freshly roast coffee. Never see Lara.\n\nLara. The thought of her exploded in my mind like a firework. I‚Äôd left her behind. I‚Äôd left her with all those half formed plans for the future that we‚Äôd never be able to put into action. She was probably laughing right now at the absurd way I went out, it was just her kind of dark humour. My heart felt heavy thinking of her; it was the first time I‚Äôd felt anything but shock since I sat down in this fucking cinema. I‚Äôd never see her again. Never watch that stupid little eye twitch she does as she falls asleep, never laugh at her otherwise shitty jokes just because she finds them so funny. Never feel her warmth next to me again as I drift off to sleep.\n\nNo, now I got to watch my next incarnation. Part of me wanted to grab a selection of junk food like I‚Äôd usually do at the movies, but after I‚Äôd got used to the dark I quickly realised there were no doors. Besides, even if there was, who the hell‚Äôs gonna want to serve hot dogs in the afterlife? All that remained was me, what must have been hundreds of me, this room, and the next life.\n\nSuddenly the screen came to life. As I watched my newest birth, the me sat next to me made sure I understood these first few years would be boring. Apparently every cycle I‚Äôm a bad baby. Always crying, whining. That crying was etched in my brain. The more I listened to it, the more I could hear myself a little in there. It was unmistakable. I watched as this woman who was my mother, but not my mother, cared for me by herself. It was interesting that she was a single mother too; something my old life had in common with my new.\n\nThe years dragged by. I went through the motions. I went through school. I made friends. I done slightly better in my grades than I had before. I watched myself make similar awkward mistakes as my teenage years. I watched myself scream the most horrible shit at my new mom, this new woman who raised me. I laughed along with my new self, and all the others watching. I cringed at my embarrassment. I felt disappointment. I felt like I was living again.\n\nExcept I wasn‚Äôt. Not really. This wasn‚Äôt really MY life. It was just a life. One of billions. I was watching someone who was both so familiar and a stranger to me. It was the little things. I didn‚Äôt prefer baths to showers. I‚Äôd never get caught dead listening to techno music. It was me broadly, but not entirely. The similarities were there though. \n\nI watched as I started college and settled down into a nearby caf√©. Just another day. At this point I was getting just as bored watching my life as this new me was living it. I was sitting sipping on a coffee, doing everything I could to avoid a lecture. I noticed how busy the caf√© was, and while I was trying to study, I could see the noise wouldn‚Äôt allow that to happen. The hum of conversation. I saw myself look up at the seat across from me, no doubt seeing everyone else sitting with someone. That was one thing we had in common; a little bit of perpetual loneliness.\n\nI watched myself finish my coffee. I watched myself almost choke on the last drop. For a second I thought I‚Äôd be dying the same way again. But I wasn‚Äôt choking normally. I just couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing. Both of me. \n\nI watched as Lara asked me ‚Äòis this seat taken?‚Äô, not giving me a chance to answer as she planked herself in the seat across from me. I awkwardly struggled to say something, but all I could get out was a quiet ‚Äòno, you can sit there if you want‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt comprehend what I was seeing. I just watched it unfold dumbly. I watched the awkward silence as I could see myself wondering whether to start a conversation. I watched her look at me with that inquisitive look on her face she always had when she expected something. I had to stop myself shouting at the screen. I couldn‚Äôt just let her walk away. \n\nEventually after what felt like a lifetime it was her that broke the silence. I suppose I should have expected that. She jokingly asked why I was still sitting there when my coffee had been empty the full time. I couldn‚Äôt feel it, but I knew my face had went red. I joked about how I was just daydreaming, and that I didn‚Äôt want to go to class. She replied simply ‚Äòwell if you don‚Äôt want to go, don‚Äôt go.‚Äô\n\nI watched myself spend that afternoon with her. I watched myself awkwardly ask for her number. No doubt I was terrified, but I couldn‚Äôt face not seeing her again. Over the next few months I watched, no, I felt myself fall in love with her again. I watched myself come up with new inside jokes that were different yet the same. I watched her do her stupid little eye twitch as she fell asleep. I laughed at her shitty jokes just because of how funny she found them. I watched myself sleep next to her, and sometimes I swear I could feel her warmth, as if she was right there beside me.\n\nI watched myself do what I‚Äôd never managed to do before. All those half assed plans we had, while not the exact same, were still there in spirit. We travelled together. I watched us have kids, I watched us grow old together. I was engrossed in every moment. I barely took my eyes off the screen, but when I did and I looked around I saw the same sense of wonder and happiness written across my face countless times. They had to have seen this play out hundreds of times, over centuries and millennia, and it still touched them the same way it did me.\n\nFinally I watched as she passed away first. Not in any funny way this time; just old age. But instead of sadness, the thought that crossed my mind was one of pure joy; she would pass on and enter a cinema somewhere. She would watch her life unfold again. For all the differences across her lifetimes, she too would watch us meet each other. Watch us fall in love again. Hell, she already had. We had together, even if not physically. And we would forever.\n\nI greeted the new me who arrived in the cinema with a smile on my face and told him to enjoy the movie.', '""What is this?"" I asked as I made my way down the aisle. \n\nIt was a normal theater, in fact it looked just like the one that I used to visit all the time with my wife, but something was... different. There were five other people in the room, all seated nearly as far apart as possible. Something prickled in the back of my mind, something that connected me to those other people, but I wasn\'t sure what it was.\n\n""What is this?"" I repeated, louder this time.\n\n""Just shut up and take a seat."" A man in the top right section of the theater shouted back.\n\nGrumbling, I found a seat in the bottom section of the theater and settled in, watching as the screen changed, showing a video that began with a blast of white light. The peculiar thing was though... as I watched, I recognized every moment of the film. It was my life. *My* life, exactly. From the moment I exited the hospital on my birth date, to the moment I took my final breath. My entire life, summed up in a five minute video.\n\n""What the...?"" I began, when someone plopped down in the seat next to me.\n\n""Pretty crazy, huh?"" A man said, and when my eyes found his, I gasped.\n\nHe looked exactly like me, as if someone had dropped me into a cloning machine. Or was I a clone of him?\n\n""What is this?"" I asked for the third time.\n\nMy clone motioned around to the theater. ""Welcome to the Brady Wells Cinema, my friend. We all wind up here eventually. The Brady in the corner up there? He was the first one of us to show up here.""\n\n""That\'s... nice."" I breathed, still awestruck by the man in front of me. ""But what is this place?""\n\nOther Brady relaxed back into his chair, letting his arms stretch out behind him. ""Call it Heaven, call it Hell, whatever you want, but we\'ve got one job while we\'re here: to watch.""\n\n""Watch what?""\n\nOther Brady pointed at the screen, which was fading from black to gray, like those scenes where someone is opening their eyes.\n\n""The next Brady. We watch his life and pray that he gets it right. If he doesn\'t, he\'ll show up here, just like you did."" At the look I gave him, Other Brady grinned. ""Aw don\'t feel bad, Brady, I\'m here too, aren\'t I?""\n\nI nodded, still not quite understanding. The screen faded to white, and then a room came into view. A hospital room, a plethora of doctors, and a very joy-struck man that held his arms out towards New Brady.\n\n""What do you mean we \'pray that he gets it right\'? Get what right?"" Someone in the upper section directed a loud *shhh!* in our direction.\n\nOther Brady casually flipped them off without ever taking his eyes off me. ""Life. If you haven\'t guessed yet, we\'re all here because we failed in some way. Brady number 3 up there? One of the richest men alive, but no kids. Not even money buys our way to the Great Beyond. So we watch. And we pray that the latest Brady gets it right, then we can all move on.""\n\n""That doesn\'t make any sense."" I said finally, struggling to keep my voice below a whisper. \n\n""What do you mean?""\n\n""You just sit here and watch? That\'s it? What\'s the point if you can\'t help the latest Brady live his life correctly? It could take a millennia to get it right."" I glanced around the theater. Only five other versions of myself in the room. How many more until we got it right?\n\n""Look, I\'m not saying I like it, or that it\'s perfect, but it\'s just how it is. I don\'t make the rules. That door you came through? It only opens once, and that\'s when the latest Brady dies, otherwise it\'s locked. So yeah, we just sit here and watch."" Other Brady whispered, keeping his eyes glued to the screen.\n\nThe latest Brady was being rocked gently by strong arms. A soft lullaby was being sung by an unseen woman. \n\n""Have you ever tried to go through the door when it is open?"" I whispered, and Other Brady spun on me so quickly, it was almost inhuman. \n\n""No,"" he hissed like a venomous serpent, ""and we aren\'t ever going to. You may not like it, Brady, but this is how it is. We sit and watch. You try to disrupt that and cause trouble? We\'ll stop you. We\'ve done it before."" And with that, Other Brady rose from his seat and relocated himself to across the room.\n\nI sighed, slumping into my seat like a pouting child. My eyes found the screen, watching reluctantly as Brady was passed off to the father. He was crying happily, hugging the baby close to his chest. Was this really all there was in the afterlife? A dim theater with irritated versions of myself? I wanted to believe that this was all some horrible dream, that I would wake up in my bed an old, weary man, but I knew I wouldn\'t. My time had passed, and now it was this New Brady\'s turn at life. I would just have to learn to deal with it.\n\nAs I watched the film, I adjusted my position in the seat, trying to get comfortable in these budget theater chairs. It was going to be a long movie.', '""No! No! Don\'t become a pornstar!""\nMe from 4 lives ago began shouting at the screen.\n\n""The male ones don\'t make any money!"" said me from 1 life ahead.\n\n""Who cares? He\'ll be living the rest of his life banging hot girls!"" objected me from 10 lives ago\n\n""But it\'s like your favorite food or music, when you have it too much you get bored."" \n\n""Not to mention the STDs,"" pointed out me from 7 lives ago.\n\n""We know you were a fucking doctor, shut the fuck up!"" The speaker (I honestly can\'t keep track of the numbers) was a boxer who had anger issues.\n\n""Make me bitch!""\n\n\'Hold up, hold up, he\'s gonna decide!"" said one of the younger mes.\n\nThe current me started deciding between a full ride to his state college and going with his contact in the industry labeled in his phone as ""Slimy Susan"".\n\nEventually, he put down his phone, and started looking up careers for an english major.\n\n""NO!"" shouted me from 4 lives ago. ""Shit, become a pornstar, become a pornstar!""\nA brawl broke out between the mes.\n\nI put my head in my hands. I\'d really prefer hell right now.', '**Day 1:**\n\nI can\'t believe this, and neither should you, frankly. Does it not to you seem contradictory in any sense that my reincarnations, all of a similar person (myself) yet different, a phenomenon I can only compare somewhat to the various editions of a book, can exist someplace all at once? ""Where is this cinema?"" I ask. None of me know the answer, but nobody leaves, and nobody but myself comes. There are 78 of me here, myself excluded, henceforth to be known in the grammatically appropriate contexts as *myselves*. The others\' appearances I simply cannot describe. They look neither old nor young ‚Äî they look visibly rejuvenated, glowing with a virtually tangible youthfulness, yet have retained in their bones and their cranium the wisdom that comes solely through old age and maturity. We are all naked, yet feel no shame.\n\nThe cinema has 10 rows of eight seats. I take my seat at the front-most row, my head permanently in motion as I observe the people around me. There do, ironically, appear to be cliques, as though 78 versions of myself could not all get along. The large screen looming ahead of us is blank, so I rise from my seat and engage in conversation with myselves, an act I am familiar with, it not being the first time I have spoken to myself. The screen remains blank.\n\n\n**Day 293:**\n\nI have not, contrary to the experiences of myselves\' many ex-girlfriends, as myselves have been only too pleased to point out, gotten bored of speaking to myselves, but am satisfied anyway with the first visible signs of life. For the first time in what feels like a decade (though I am assured by Myself #23, the official timekeeper, that it is the 293rd day of Myself #80\'s life), the cinema lights up, rather abruptly. There appears briefly to be a problem with the sound system ‚Äî which, I should mention, emitted exactly what Myself #80 heard during his time in his mother\'s womb ‚Äî but it eventually returns to normal, and the screen is filled with a light so bright that as I turn my head to look around, for the first time since my abrupt materialisation in the dimly-lit cinema I am able to properly see my surroundings. As myselves return to their seats from the circles they had formed with their cliques, I follow suit to observe the birth of Myself #80, Arturo Bennedetto.\n\n\n**Day 3087:**\n\nArturo is growing up rather nicely. He\'s a bright boy, with a wit far sharper than that of his peers, and a passion for reading that most of myselves and I can relate to. Here he is now, waking blissfully to the delicate birdsong, which floats gently through his open window to alight, note by note, on his forehead. He cleans up and hops downstairs, only to see his parents arguing heatedly over the island counter in his kitchen for the seventeenth consecutive day, not that they are aware of his maturity and the fact that he has been keeping count. Not that they care anyway. Bitterly, he pours a cup of water down his throat, and leaves the room.\n\n\n**Day 6201:**\n\nArturo has dressed his best. Out the door he strolls in suit and tie, ignoring completely his bickering parents, having already been desensitized, every one of his steps oozing with confidence, the sunny summer weather perfectly reflecting his cheer. Down the pavement he walks, whistling a cheerful air, arriving, inevitably, at Ambra Carino\'s. Prom is just around the corner, and who better to ask to it? After all, they are best friends, united not only through a love of literature but their troubled pasts and the intricacy of their characters.\n\nWith two self-assured knocks at her door, myselves and I eagerly awaiting what surely will be a rare day to celebrate, he announces his arrival. There is no response. He glances at his watch ‚Äî it is half past 12. Knowing Ambra lives alone and there is no risk of waking another, he knocks again, on this occasion more than twice, and again, till five minutes have passed. His imagination providing several pessimistic reasons for the lack of a response, as is only typical of it, Arturo runs to the backdoor and knocks again. The silence is disquieting. He sheepishly calls her cellphone, only to have nobody pick up, and rereads their texts, only to detect nothing abnormal, nor any announcement of her leaving the house. A tear beginning to well in his eye, more out of the somewhat unreasonable but very real concern and fear his personality naturally generates than anything else, he reaches for the top of the door-frame, clasping with relief the key he knew he would find, and shoving it, with trembling fingers, into the keyhole.\n\nAs the door swings open, he runs into the house and up the flight of stairs, arriving first at her bedroom door. Despite managing to calm himself down enough to at least knock at the door again, there is again no response. Arturo takes a step back, runs at the door, and kicks it open with his right foot. As it swings on its hinges, ricocheting off the wall on which it is mounted before once again covering the frame of the door, Arturo glimpses a sight of unimaginably horrifying proportions, much to his shock, and ours too. The bedroom door sways close, hiding Ambra\'s hanging, lifeless body, and Arturo, his self-confidence depleted, his swagger torn to shreds, simply doesn\'t know what to do. He presently decides to break down and cry.\n\n\n**Day 6210:**\n\n""What will happen when the final seat is taken?"" I once asked Myself #2.\n\n""Who knows?"" he replied. ""Perhaps we will all be reincarnated and a new circle will begin. Perhaps some of us will go to heaven and some to hell. Less unrealistically, though, perhaps the cinema will just continue to fill.""\n\nAs Arturo falls, then, from the top of the building, bracing himself for the impact, yet relatively sanguine, willing the earth to envelope him and to welcome him, I, too, brace myself for the impact, and mourn the loss of Myself #80.\n\n**[Edits: attempts at formatting.]**', 'The curtains shrugged, their red cotton billowing as they parted. Behind them, a huge screen began to flicker with grey and white dots: the static of anticipation.\n\nTracey looked around her; she wasn\'t scared -- she knew where she was. Or at least *roughly*, she knew where she was. Mainly boys and girls sat on the tall, crimson seats around her -- a few older looking children too, but no adults. Just... freaks whose faces were a twisted abnormality of her own; who wore self-satisfied smiles as the tossed popcorn at each other and giggled stupidly. It was like flicking through a family photo album that had been half melted in a fire. She already hated them and their happiness. \n\n""Hey,"" said a boy next to her. ""You\'re new here, right?"" Tracey was about to tell him to *mind-his-own-damned-business*, when she noticed his smile. The boy\'s front tooth, on the left side, was chipped almost identically to her own. ""My name\'s Andrew,"" he said. ""Are you a Tracey or an Emily, or...""\n\nHe left a gap for Tracey to fill in. She didn\'t\n\nThe boy pushed his popcorn towards her; popped kernels spilled over the edge like a frothing wave.\n\n""Do you want some? We can share -- it\'s not problem, I can always get more.""\n\n""Your tooth,"" she said, pointing to her own. ""How did you?""\n\nHe giggled. ""Same way the rest of us d-""\n\n""Shh,"" said someone behind them. ""*It\'s starting.*""\n\nA moving picture appeared on the screen; black and white, like one of those movies she\'d never watched fully when they came on television. The image was of a small town Tracey recognised. There were swollen, black clouds lurking menacingly over it, throwing their heavy burden down onto the town as if out of spite. As Tracey watched, the image panned in on the sprawling grey brick of the town\'s only hospital -- then went closer still, closer to the ground, until it arrived outside the hospital\'s wide front door. A voice began to speak as the camera rushed down sterile hallways; a voice deep and rich, with a resonance that sent a shiver down Tracey\'s spine.\n\n""Emily Oates was born in the town of Thicket Springs, on January the first, 2004. As the small, former mining town battled against the worst storm it had witnessed in over fifty years, Julia Oates battled inside Saint Mary\'s hospital for something else entirely: her life, and that of her baby."" \n\n""You might want to look away,"" whispered Andrew. ""Most don\'t like this part, but personally... I like seeing what she looked like. It\'s better than the photos."" He smiled goofily as he looked back at the screen.\n\nTracey glanced around the cinema; many of the children were covering their eyes or holding their popcorn bags in front of their faces.\n\nThe camera focused on her mother\'s straining face, as blood vessels inside her burst. On the tears that fell from her beaming face as -- for just a moment -- she heard her baby girl cry.\n\n""This was a battle Julia believed she won,"" said the deep voice, sounding at least slightly mournful. ""Even as her eyes closed, for a final time.""\n\nTracey swallowed hard, determined not to let tears well in her eyes. She never cried. No. It wouldn\'t happen!\n\nThe film moved on: the funeral and the mourners dressed in black, smiling as they hovered over the pram. Her dad always there for her; feeding and changing and singing to her. Then, it showed a side of him she couldn\'t have known about back then; the manifested depression that he\'d suffered on losing his wife. How when she slept in her crib, he never did. When his lullabies sent her to a peaceful sleep, he would take a bottle of whiskey to his room and drink until the sun rose or she cried out.\n\n""I didn\'t know..."" she whispered, not meaning to say it out loud.\n\n""Of course not,"" said Andrew. ""How could we have done?""\n\n""We?""\n\n""You must have guessed who we all are, right?""\n\n""I...You\'re... you\'re other me-s?""\n\n""Yeah. Like I\'m the brother you never had. And you\'re my sister.""\n\nAgain, Tracey wrestled back a smile. How she\'d always longed for a sibling.\n\nThe narrator continued and the film moved on.\n\nThere was a roar of laughter whenever the baby on the screen giggled; more laughs as she grew older, and a little wiser -- when her dad asked her to eat her apple, and she responded with: *uh-uh, look what it did to snow white.* Even Tracey couldn\'t stifle a chuckle. There was a roar when the accident on the see-saw came -- and a lot of hands raised to soothe a phantom pain that had made itself known on their chipped front teeth.\n\nBut the laughter soon died as she grew older, and as the screen showed her father, sitting in his office with a pile of bills on the table next to him.\n\nThe audience in the cinema became hushed.\n\nHer father picked up a coin and flicked it. It landed on heads. \n\nHe cried into his hands and fumbled for a bottle of whiskey in the cupboard below.  \n\n""What\'s going on?"" asked Tracey.\n\n""It\'s the day he decided... you know.""\n\n""Oh...""\n\n""Yeah. That he couldn\'t go on like this.""\n\nTracey didn\'t stop the tears this time. The girl -- that sweet baby on the screen -- was going to go down the same road as her. The loss of her father. Living with her uncle and... all that came with him. The school, the bullies -- no one believing. She ran a hand gently over her wrists.\n\nAndrew must have seen her tears because he leaned over and squeezed her hand. ""It\'s okay,"" he said gently.\n\n""How!"" she screamed. ""How is it okay?"" She flung his hand away and tried to get up -- but she couldn\'t. She couldn\'t move.\n\n""Because we get a new friend. Because she gets a new friend, too. People that love her.""\n\n""That doesn\'t make it okay!"" she yelled as hot tears and snot streaked her face.\n\n""Maybe not, but it\'s what happens. And one day, this""--he waved his arms around the cinema--""this all changes. We all move on. Until then, enjoy the moments of happiness, and try to forget the bad.""\n\n""I don\'t want to watch any more! I can\'t!""\n\n""You\'re not alone, Tracey. Not any more. It is Tracey, right? We\'ve all been through it. *All of us*. The first time is always so difficult. And honestly, it\'s never easy. But know this -- you\'re loved. You always were, you know. He does it because he didn\'t want you seeing him like that. Because he wanted you to have a better life.""\n\n""...that\'s not what happened.""\n\n""It\'s what he hoped would happen. Your mother would have given her own life a hundred times over for you, too.""\n\n""I-""\n\nAndrew took her hand again. ""So would I. So would any of us."" \n\n""Will- will this keep happening? Will there be infinite Emilys?""\n\n""No. Eventually something different will happen. Maybe our mom will live, or something, and everything will be different. And when things change, when a Tracey or an Emily -- or whoever -- has a proper shot at life, we all move on. Until then, Tracey, we\'ve at least got each other.""\n\nAs Tracey looked at Andrew, there was sudden a gasp that filled the huge room -- as if every child had taken in a huge lungful of air all at once. Even Andrew looked in shock.\n\nTracey looked up at the screen.\n\n""What made him look in Emily\'s room before going to the attic as intended,"" said the narrator, ""we may never know.""\n\nShe watched, as her father crept in and kissed Emily on the forehead.\n\n""But whatever his reason, he decided he would change things.""\n\nThere was an eruption of applause and cheering as the first bottle of whiskey was emptied into the sink.\n\n""And change things he would.""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""**Off-Topic Discussion**: All top-level comments must be a story or poem.

Definitely not. \n\n'It's the glands' I said. Well not me, but Me. A different short, thin, nervous looking man. 'You don't have any.'\n\nI could have questioned what I meant by that, but a loud noise disrupted my thoughts. A scream, followed by thunderous applause from Me, Me, Me and a hundred other Mes. A few dogs, maybe 3 cats and even a pot of petunias, but all of them had a distinct 'Meness'. Maybe it was the eyes. Or the way they seemed to slouch into their seats, trying to hide themselves from the world. Can a petunia slouch?\n\nMore screaming, not from fear, but from some innate need to make a noise. The screen, which had faded into the background well, despite the fact it pretty much was one of the walls of the room, showed a hospital room, a smiling face that looked eerily familiar and a man dressed in doctors scrubs shouting 'It's a boy' gleefully at the room in general.\n\nThis was going to be a long movie.\n"", '""GOD DAMMIT!

""Maybe our next life will understand that.""\n\nThe screen turned a bright white and we heard ourselves cry.', 'John blinked away the blindness that had overtaken him, his ears filled to the brim with the sound of the car horn and tires screeching fading into a constant dull ringing. As he regained his vision, his heart skipped a beat and his brain seemed to short circuit. Where the hell was he?   \n   \nHis hearing came back to him, replaced by an equally deafening silence as he realized that the occupants of the movie theater in which he had mysteriously found himself were all watching him. Hadn\'t he been walking home from the bar? Did he just black out and imagine those headlights careening towards him?   \n   \nTaking a deep breath to center himself, John made his way towards one of the aisles and took a seat. Most of the people near the front stopped staring and turned away to aim their sights at the barren canvas of the movie screen. As if to defy their attempted return to normalcy, a younger kid, John thought he might be in his teens despite his face being cloaked in shadow, hopped over two aisles and threw himself into the seat beside John, ""Sup?""   \n   \nHe felt immediately annoyed. It was mostly the embarrassment. Who the hell blacks out on a couple of beers and wanders into a movie theater? As the kid started to talk to him, John\'s eyes closed and he drew in a deep breath. The smell of stale popcorn and a familiar stench that he could only describe as his own flooded through his nostrils and into his lungs. He scolded himself for not wearing enough deodorant as the kid introduced himself, ""Name\'s John. You?"" John could hear someone down front groan in response to this new insult to the sacred silence of the theater.   \n   \nJohn tried to formulate a response. Did he just tell the kid to fuck off? No, the kid might have the balls to make a scene of it and then John would be even deeper in the shit with these strangers. Better to play the game for a bit, maybe the kid would shut up when the movie started. What movie had his drunk-self been so desperate to see? The thought rolled through his mind as he tried his best to keep his volume down, ""Your parents have good taste. Just like mine. Name\'s John.""   \n   \nHe stuck out his hand and the kid took it. Despite the teen\'s youth, he already seemed to have a bit of muscle on him. His grip was strong, and he seemed to want to show it as he went just a step into the uncomfortable with his squeeze. ""So, uh, kid. John. What movie is this?"" The Kid lifted his shoulders and let them fall to form a shrug, ""Our movie. Well, another rendition."" John\'s brow curled into a frown that his lips sought to mimic, ""The hell is that supposed to mean?"" The kid leaned through the darkness and into the beam of empty light being spewed by the projector near the back, ""You\'re dead, dude.""   \n   \nJohn wanted to fight it. He wanted to tell the kid to shut up and just watch the movie, or to push himself out of the chair and barrel through the door into the outside, regardless of what the other patrons here might think. Yet, he knew that face. He could barely recognize himself, years of drinking and bad eating and sitting around undoing what little beauty nature had put upon him. ""How?""   \n   \nYoung John shrugged. ""It makes no sense to most of us. I\'m one of the oldest here and I still don\'t really get it. Nobody\'s come along to tell us what what\'s up. I haven\'t met an angel or a devil or a God. Just that big screen up there and repeatedly coming face to face with disappointment."" John\'s temper flared as the last words tumbled out of his younger self\'s mouth. As he opened his own, the projector reel started to roll to life and the screen turned black. ""The hell do you mean, coming face to face with disappointment?""   \n   \nYoung John was no longer looking at him. Instead, his eyes were locked on that inky blackness that stretched like an open maw before them. ""I died young. Drunk driver. Didn\'t get the chance that most of us here got. So imagine how it feels to watch yourself turn into what put you here.""   \n   \nAnother John in front of them turned and put his fingers to his lips, pushing a shush past them. Young John sneered at him, ""Fuck off."" John opened his mouth to fight the accusation, but as he tried to wrap his mind around it, his mind instead unwrapped around the hazy black memory that he had mistaken for a blacked out saunter into the movie theater. His heart fell into the pit of his stomach as lurid memories slipped into place of his fingers clenched tight around a steering wheel, the bulk of his car lurching left and right while he fumbled for a cigarette and his lighter, and the sudden stop as he and his car tied themselves into a neat little bow around a telephone pole. ""No..""   \n   \n""Yes."" Young John was staring at him, but even in the darkness John could tell that he seemed almost sorry. ""So this is hell, then? We get to watch ourselves become what we hate?"" Sound started to pump through the speakers. The sound of doctors and nurses and his own crying as a new John made his way into the world. ""It\'s not really hell-"" Young John\'s reply was cut short when Another John turned in his seat and spit his venom at them, ""Look, dipshits, its starting. Just watch the movie and keep your mouths shut. Some of us want to see what will happen."" Young John pushed himself out of his chair and flipped his other self off, ""Do you want to go? I remember your run, rotting away in your house, watching other people do what you wanted on the internet. You don\'t get to speak up now, dipshit."" Another John pushed himself out of his chair, his frame chubbier than his peers, ""You know I was disabled, jackass. I\'ll kick your ass even with a bum leg.""   \n   \nThe theater started to grow restless as the sound of his new infantile self\'s crying seemed to parody the ongoing dispute between the youth and adult. John was fairly sure he was right on the money with this being hell. Stepping up, he lifted his hands and motioned for both gentlemen to sit down, ""Look, I\'ll stay quiet and watch the movie. Thanks for helping me out, uh, John. Maybe afterwards you could..you could..."" His urge to speak faltered and the rest of the theater\'s occupants settled down immediately as a sound other than his own crying started to pump through the speakers.   \n   \nA woman\'s voice, unfamiliar yet more comforting than he had ever known, quelled the cries of the infant that he had barely been paying attention to. A wetness formed at the corner of his eyes as he turned to stare at the screen, a face he only recognized from pictures staring back at him with a pride he had never known someone could hold in their heart for him. ""Is that really her?"" His breath caught in his throat as she started to sing him a lullaby, spreading a warmth through his body that he had been looking for all his wasted life. Young John nodded beside him, ""This isn\'t hell. This is just another chance. You know, you only notice your fuck ups when looking back because you\'ve got no reason to notice when you managed to get shit right. No reason to look into fixing what aint broke, right? I like to think the point is that once one of us gets it right, we all get to see it happen. Leave us with at least a little satisfaction and comfort despite what may have happened during our turn.""   \n   \nJohn nodded and settled back down into his seat. Down front some of him openly wept. In his mind, in all their mind\'s, they wished that little cooing child the best of luck and thanked whatever forces that be that they finally got to see her, cancer be damned.', 'Sometimes I wonder how much our lives remember about the others, I mean surely I couldn\'t be this stupid. Even as a twelve year old none of us have ever been foolhardy enough to think jumping off a roof in an attempt to fly would be a good idea. Sure we\'ve wondered if the ability was hidden, but we weren\'t stupid enough to try it. Sitting in the movie theater I glanced around to see a rainbow of me\'s. We were all different in our own ways, in all manner of colors and shapes, but we all had the same basic facial structure and personality. They all stared in abject horror as little 10 yr. old us gazed over the edge of the roof wearing a cape and a bike helmet. ""Don\'t jump you idiot!"" ""Trust us! If none of us can fly, you can\'t either!"" Their shouts were in vain as she threw her cape back and plunged off the roof. All at once we were pulled into her consciousness and watched as we plunged toward the rocks in the flower bed below. *Craaaack!* We were fading between her mind\'s eye and the theater; I wasn\'t in the mood to die today, but oh well. It\'s not like someone else wasn\'t ready for their turn at life. Suddenly  we, I, felt a rush of urgency.\n\n *This is not our last life, but it is the last one we have to save the world. I need all of you. Stay with me* \n\n', 'Bang! Bang!\n\n""A life well lived"" I thought as I collapsed to the ground. Everything was made slow and it sounded like Gospel.\nI gasped for air, not out of fear but out of habit. My entire life I felt dead, supressed, and now I finally get to compare it to the real thing. \n\nMy partner rushed to my side and I took this opportunity to say my final words. \n\n""Buddy! Buddy, you\'re gonna make it through this.""\n\n""Heh, sorry kid. But I\'d take this over a heart attack any day of the week.""\n\n""No! No. You\'re gonna make it through this, look me in the eye and tell me you\'re gonna make it through this.""\n\n""I can\'t tell a lie. He got me good this time.""\n\n""No, Buddy come o-""\n\n""Jackson, I ain\'t got much time left, kid. Listen to me. Carefully. I left you a couple thousand in the safe behind the big painting. I want you to take it and then I want you to get out of the Country.""\n\n""No no no, man, we promised we\'d get out of here together.""\n\n""This old Reprobate promised many things, kid. But in a way, we are getting out of here together.""\n\n""Stop. Knock it off. There\'s a doctor nearby you\'re gonna make it.""\n\n""No. If I\'m going I want it to be on my terms. I want you to take my horse, my bandana, my hat, and my gun.""\n\n""I c-""\n\n""Yes you-,"" the throbbing grew more intense. ""Yes you can.""\n\nThe sounds of horses grew louder, I glanced in the direction of our soon to be old home. I looked at the Sheriff who now has a bullet in his forehead. I looked at the dust cloud getting bigger and bigger, and shouting getting louder and louder. \n\n""It\'s now or never, kid. Get outta my sight.""\n\nJackson ran off towards the base. He made himself scarce, just before he went inside to grab the money he turned around and spoke our Oath one last time.\n\n""We may be Guilty...""\n\n""... But we fight for the innocent...""\n\n""... We may be fighters...""\n\n""...But we fight for the pacifists...""\n\n""...We may be Sinners...""\n\n""... But we fight for the Saints...""\n\n""... We may be dead...""\n\n""... But we fight for the living.""\n\nThose were the last words to leave my lips. The dust cloud disappeared and so did Jackson. Everything was black and white. The pain was unbearable. I somehow managed to get back on my knees, but at that very moment the Cavalry rose above the hill. I took the Sheriff\'s gun as well as aim.\n\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\n\n*Reload* Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Ba-\n\nThe music cut out and everything was dark. There was nothing. I couldn\'t see. Couldn\'t feel. Couldn\'t even breath. However something told me that I didn\'t really need to. I saw a small light, but opposed to the bright ball of light that they talk about, it was a vertical line. Nonetheless, I approached it. The closer and closer I got, the more curious I grew. I reached the wall of light and studied it. After a minute of pure bewilderment, I took a deep breath and pushed forward. \n\nApplause erupted so unbelievably loud that it made my ears ring. I looked at myself, my trademark brown duster was replaced with a suit, my black, messy hair was now properly gelled, and the holes that were previously in my ribs were gone. I walked across the Red Carpet that was at my feet and I noticed something rather peculiar. Everybody around me shared my face and there was a gigantic screen in front of all of us. As confusion grew the carpet shortened, I took my seat where a Red Velvet chair proudly stated my name: *Buddy Felter*.\n\nI looked at my Doppleganger to the left of me. The only variation between the two of us is the fact that he was wearing circular little glasses and his stubble was gone.\n\n""Hey, Partner.""\n\nHe cut me off, ""If you\'re wondering what\'s going on all will be explained in a matter of minutes. Just give these Gentleman some time to prepare.""\n\nHis voice was different too. He sounded more formal. More educated. I respected his word and sat in utter curiosity until a man with a white beard got on stage.\n\n""Wasn\'t that incredible Folks! You can\'t resist a good Western! Everybody give another round of applause to Buddy Felter in his life film, Deadeye!"" After the applause died down I took my seat again and the host cleared his throat.\n\n""The next Life we will be watching today is  called, Countdown. The inspirational life of reincarnation 334, or Ace King. The man born to be an Astronaut. Once again, I am your host. The life will begin in just a few moments. Enjoy!""\n\nThe man made his away over to me.\n\n""Greetings Mr. Felter. I know you have a lot of questions. Feel free to as-""\n\n""Yeah, Howdy. Um, I think I just got one: What the undying hell is going on?""\n\n""Yeah that\'s normally the first question the reincarnations ask. Alright, so you see everybody around you? They\'re all you. Do you believe in Reincarnation, sir? Well if you didn\'t you should now. What we are doing, and what we have just done with you was watch your life go down.

Don\'t worry, I know it sounds long. It really isn\'t, took a few millennia last time and you reincarnations didn\'t even have to suffer through it all. The show will be starting soon so please enjoy. I\'m your host, God, call one of my Angels if you need any snacks or refreshments.""\n\nI sat back. Bewildered. This seemed truly unbelievable. I left everything. My home. My world. Jackson. All gone. All for tickets to the cinema. And I didn\'t even get front row. This was my life now. I looked around at the reincarnations. The longer I seemed to stare the more different they looked. The 3 2 1 countdown on the Life ended and the movie began.\n\n""It\'s a beautiful baby boy Mrs. And Mr. King.""\n\n""He\'s beautiful.""\n\n""Hey there little guy... Honey he\'s gonna be something great one day. I just know it. He\'ll be up there with the stars.""\n\nI straightened my bowtie, I ordered a bag of popcorn, and I dared not take my eyes off the screen.\n\nMy story\'s over. \n\nBut not mine.', '[deleted]', 'I walked into a strange area. It looked somewhat like the theaters nobles when to. But this was much larger. There had to be thousands of people in the seat. And there was a large piece of parchment with moving pictures. ""What the hell..."" I said aloud as I reached the front. ""It\'s called a cinema"" answered a man who looked like a knight. ""Here, you\'re 2 seats down from me, next to that young woman.""\n\n I sat down slowly, confused, when all of sudden the young lady turned to face me. She was... crying? ""Oh kain!"" She cried out as she reached out and hugged me. ""Katherine calm yourself!"" demanded the knight, ""Allow me to apologize. You were her first viewing and due to her status a princess, she was shocked to witness your humble beginnings as a peasant and as you rose up the latter but never lost your kindness, she began to fall in love with you.""\n\n""Viewing?"" I questioned. ""Ah yes"" he said ""As I recall you\'re  #6027."" ""What are you talking about? Where are we? What the do you even mean by viewing?""  I screamed. The knight chuckled ""Watch the screen and find out. I sighed and reluctantly looked at the screen. As I watched it all started to make sense. \n\nFast forward 800 years. We\'ve reached the me in the 21st century. He\'s a pretty good guy. Smart too. Although #6028 doesn\'t like him at all. Says he\'s not cruel enough. Although I don\'t bother myself was his opinion. 6028 (otherwise known as arther) grew up a spoiled noble and never learned the value of kindness even after 800 years. The guys a major prick. However, me a Katherine are doing ok. I know the idea of dating yourself sounds weird but she did know me pretty intimately and well, when you\'re in a theater for all eternity it\'s nice to have someone to spend your time with.  \n\n""Ah looks like Niels time is up"" I said.  ""Too bad"" Katherine pouted, ""I really liked him! He reminded me of you honey!"" ""Good riddance"" spat Arthur ""He was such a pansy!"" Well time to move on to the next me. The screen started back up again. ""Hey does anyone remember what year it is?"" I yelled to the various me\'s. ""It\'s 2041 A.D., can\'t you keep track of the time?"" yelled Brutus. ""Hey fuck you brutus at least Kain doesn\'t stab his friends in the back!"" shouted Katherine. I chuckled but then all our fun was cut short by a booming laugh from the back of the theater.  It was #1. This was a shock to everyone considering #1 never talked to anyone. ""I\'ve been so bored all these billions of years""  he said ""but FINALLY something interesting is happening!"" Everyone seemed to be deeply disturbed due to 1\'s outburst. I decided to speak out ""What do you mean 1?"" ""Hahaha can\'t you feel it Kain? It\'s finally happening! This is the last one."" 1 declared. ""Last one? What do you mean?"" I asked. 1 yelled out for everyone to hear ""Rejoice for all of us will finally be united! This is the last cycle! This... is the end of the world.""\n\nThis is the first time I\'ve ever done this so tell me what you guys think.', 'My eyes shot open, but I wasn‚Äôt welcome to any shiny gates. Hellfire wasn‚Äôt present either, as I stood in the middle of a movie lobby. Fear chilled my spine as a hand gripped my shoulder.\n\n‚ÄúWell if isn‚Äôt the superhero.‚Äù A voice that sounded eerily like my own said. I turned my head, and a deer in headlights would‚Äôve been my closest twin. \n\n‚ÄúGod, you‚Äôre me?‚Äù I stammered, as this clone howled the same way I would when something really funny happened. \n\n‚ÄúAh, I love greeting the new guys. I‚Äôm you, the very first you in fact. Come on, you‚Äôre missing the movie.‚Äù He stuffed a platter in my chest with popcorn and a drink on it. My memory became more clear as we moved through the corridor. Stereotypical push child out of the way of a moving vehicle, and I died. Damn anime got me killed.\n\nMy jaw dropped because there I was on the screen. Somehow, someway I was starring in a movie that I don‚Äôt remember being in. Then it clicked, he‚Äôs me in the future. Looks like he lucked out with a bit more height, but other than that he was me. As I made my way into the theater, there was me, scattered about and maybe a couple noticed my presence.\n\nLooks like the subject for this one was this flick was his first date. ‚ÄúDamn, look at me, she‚Äôs a fucking 10,‚Äù I heard from the back of the theater. To no surprise he got a couple chuckles.\n\nI thought this kid was smooth, until he flipped his date‚Äôs plate onto her dark gown. You could see the tears gathering in the  young lady‚Äôs eyes, as he tried to comfort her. She stormed away from the table, and his face met his hands.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck man, how are you me and can‚Äôt seal on dates?‚Äù Looks like I may have quite the womanizer in the past.\n\n‚ÄúCut the kid some slack, remember what happened with Cleopatra?‚Äù The theater had erupted, as the flick changed to an Egyptian setting. Maybe death wont be so bad after all.', 'The movies were frequently short. \n\nSometimes the merest hint of pinkish light, then claustrophobic discomfort against a thin barrier.\n\nOther times, there was daylight from a window as my kin and I spilled out onto a towel. We lay there, drying quickly and dying. \n\nOccasionally one of the films would last somewhat longer. I would emerge out into the world for a few brief years before being chased and eaten by some large predator.\n\nThe different, short films seemed to go on for centuries. \n\nFinally, a film I recognized. Mine. My life. ', 'I awoke with a massive jolt my body spasming and locking up taking in deep breaths. My vision blurred a faint oily shadow in the shape of a man stands over me.\n""I think he\'s waking up!""\n\nIn the distance another set of voices roar ""Bout bloody time too"" ""He should\'ve paid attention!"" ""What a bloody idiot!"" ""Oh c\'mon guys anyone could make that mistake."" From the back of the cinema a voice shouted ""He walked into a busy road!""\n\nI sat up my vision clearing and seeing...me? ""Holy shit"" I spasmed out scooched away from me hitting the theatre walls. The theatre roared into laughter and then I saw them, there was at least twenty no thirty me\'s they all looked like me but each wearing different clothing some looking older or younger. \n\n""Where...where am I?"" I spoke panicked the other me stood up wearing what appeared to be military uniform from World War One at a glance he appeared English. ""I\'m sorry to say you\'ve died"" he said flatly as though he has said this to many others. \n\n""Died? How? No. This place can\'t be real I\'m having a nightmare, yes a nightmare"" I said rambling on until I received a short sharp smack to my face. The solder stood over me ""No son, you\'re dead and this is where we all go"".\n\nI looked around and took in the room, it was like a 1950s era cinema but much larger than usual the seats a dark red worn velvet with off cream coloured walls. The surreal site of seeing all these me\'s made it hard not to make my head spin even seeing a anothet me walking down the isle offering snacks. ""Food, drink, bets, we have it all here!"".\n\nI\'m gonna stop here cause I have work. üòÖ', '""It wasn\'t my phone that woke me up, but my wife. She\'s always been a lighter sleeper than me, and even though I had it on silent, the constant stream of notification vibrations was making the phone shuck and jive all over my nightstand.\n\n""Honey. Hoooooooney. HONEY!"" I came awake to a rough shake accompanying the words. ""Yeahwah?"" I managed, blearily.\n\n""Your phone. Somebody is blowing you up."" \n\n""Must be my other girlfriend."" An old joke, wildly inappropriate considering what was to follow. ""Mmhhmm."" She mumbled, already well on her way back to sleep. I checked the bedside clock; the red LED showing 3 am on the nose. Weird. I leaned awkwardly, half awake, and grabbed my phone, and had to do a doubletake when I saw the notifications. 186 texts, 93 missed calls, and one emergency notification. What. The Actual. Fuck? I thought, ok, this is a dream, must be a dream. I don\'t even know 186 people. Ok. Must be a natural disaster on the way. Or did Kim Jong Un launch nukes at the west coast? Shit. \n\nWith slightly shaking hands, I thumbed the official notification, expecting the worst. I held my breath. \n\n""DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.""\n\nWait, what? The feeling of surreal vertigo intensified. The logical part of my brain was continuing to insist that this was, this MUST, be a dream, must be a dream, must be...\n\n""Shut up, shut up."" I whispered to myself, climbing out of bed. I was awake now, fully, rigidly awake, and so I decided to take my phone to the living room to investigate further. Plopping down on the couch, I started scrolling through texts. ""Curiouser and curiouser,"" I mumbled to myself, looking at the texts. None of them from numbers I recognized. Some of them...not even from phone numbers. Entries from numbers with only 8 digits, or 6, or 2. Entries with letters and numbers mixed together. Entries with letters and numbers and Chinese characters mixed in. Emojis and symbols mixed in. My disquiet was growing steadily. I clicked the first message. \n\n""Wow, look at the moon! It\'s so big and beautiful. Amazing, isn\'t it""\n\nSo, ok, my brain responded. Not a dream. A practical joke. Someone is messing with me. With my phone. I wonder if my wife is in on this. I clicked the next text.\n\n""It\'s such a beautiful night tonight. Just look! The moon looks amazing. It\'s so big!""\n\n""Look at the moon! Wow, it looks so cool! Look honey!""\n\nSomething about the ""honey"" sent a chill up my spine. My wife, shaking me awake, popped back into my mind, unbidden.\n\n""Look at that moon out over the water honey!"" It looks so huge so close to the horizon. Why does it do that?""\n\n""It\'s such a beautiful night honey, look! Wow, the moon looks awesome!""\n\nAnd as I was reading these, I realized, I could hear a voice speaking the words. Quietly, like they were coming from very far away, repeating, looping over each other, blurring speeding up, slowing down, warping. \n\nLook at the moon, go outside, look at the moon, go outside, look at the moon, it\'s a beautiful night, go look at the moon.""\n\nMustering all the calm I could, I set my phone, face down, on the couch. Some still logical functionality commanded me to turn on the TV. Turn on the news. Yes. Normalcy. Emergency broadcast system. Yes. That\'s a good idea. I turned it on. It\'s 3 am, surely more than a minute has passed but it says 3 am, right there in the corner of the screen, 3:00AM PDT, and even though it\'s the middle of the night, there\'s Anderson Cooper, and he\'s staring at me, I swear he\'s looking right at me, and suddenly turning on the news seems like it was a really bad idea. \n\n""West coast residents are being warned tonight not to look at the moon. Authorities are warning that looking at the moon might destroy your life and could unravel the very fabric of reality. Ben, DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.""\n\nI pressed the power button again on the remote and the TV shut off. Heart trying to thud its way out of my chest, I stood, and walked back towards my bedroom. Somehow, I knew before I opened the door that my wife would be awake, and she was. She was sitting up, her face lit by her phone screen. \n\n""I shouldn\'t have told you to look at the moon, honey. I\'m sorry.""\n\n""Wait, what? Are you?...Are you in on this too? What is going on!""\n\nShe looked down, and started crying. ""I\'m sorry, honey. I\'m so so sorry.""\n\nI rushed over and sat down hard on the bed, right in front of her. ""Sorry for what!"" I demanded, panic seizing control of me as I grabbed her shoulders. ""Sorry for WHAT! What THE FUCK is going on!!?? Sorry for what??!!""\n\nShe stopped crying, and smiled. Her eyes were far away, glazed, almost robotic. ""Oh WOW!"" she said ""Wow, honey, it\'s such a beautiful night tonight! Just look at the moon!""\n\nI let go of her shoulders, and stood up. I walked calmly, out of the room, out through the living room to the hall to the back door. I threw it open, feeling like my arms and legs were moving on their own. Like I was merely a passenger. I could feel my pulse in my ears. I stepped out, into my backyard. I tilted my head to the sky, and I looked at the moon. \n\nAnd then I remembered. God help me, I remembered. Driving along, southbound on coast highway, coming home from a long night. She was tired, dried sweat had warped her perfect hairdo, but she still looked radiant. Face lit by the dash lights, and of course, by the moon. She had sung her heart out tonight, and the crowd had eaten it up. She was a bright shining star, tonight. Hanging out there, seeming mere inches from the horizon, the big, swollen, full face of the moon. Just about to set. \n\n""Oh WOW!"" she said ""Wow, honey, it\'s such a beautiful night tonight! Just look at the moon!"" \n\nAnd I did. I took my eyes off the road, and I did. She was right, of course. It was beautiful.""\n\nI sighed.\n\n""And then I heard an awful sound, like a loud pop, and we were upside down, flying, weightless, like somehow we had been pulled by the moon into space. The car was full of weird things floating through the air, coins, a pen cap, her mic had even floated in from the back into the front. I had one last look at her face. It was still transitioning from the marvel at the beauty of the moon to the shock of the crash. I tried to reach out my hand, but I seemed to be moving through jello. The moon filled the windshield, seemed to get even bigger, brighter, turned the sky white, turned the whole world white.""\n\nI wept a little then. Not as much as I would, later, but a little. \n\n""You know the rest,"" I said when I had regained my composure. ""I came out of the coma. I woke up here.""\n\nThe officer stared at me, and I could tell she was struggling to keep her face impassive. She felt bad for me, but she didn\'t want to. \n\n""I\'m sorry for your loss."" she said, looking down at her notepad. She hadn\'t taken down a single word of it. ""Can you tell me how much you\'d had to drink that night?""\n\nI sighed again. Could I? No, not really. Quite a few. Too fucking many.\n\n""No,"" I answered. ""No, I don\'t think I can.""\n\nShe nodded. ""You\'re going to need a lawyer. When you\'re ready to get out of here, I mean.""\n\nI looked down at my broken body. Just a mess of wires and tubes and casts. ""Yeah,"" was all I could muster. \n\nShe stood, and walked toward the door of my hospital room. She put her hand on the door, and without turning, she asked, ""do you think if you\'d obeyed the warning, you\'d still be in the coma?"" \n\n""Yes,"" I said, quietly. ""Yes, I do.""', 'Have you heard the wolf howl?  The sound that echoes in your bones, that makes needles race across your skin.\n\nMy grandmother used to say that all wolves howl from instinct.  In memory of something long before, in connection with their ancestors.  And the dogs, they howl from the remnants of instinct from when they were wolves.  From the part of them that remembers the pack, the hunt, the fury.\n\nShe said what makes us human is forgetting our instincts.  Left in the wild, how few of us would survive?  How many would know how to stalk prey, would remember how to survive snow naked, or to how to hide from the hungry tiger?\n\nFew.\n\nTonight, when the moon rose, it was as if there was a presence over my shoulders, as if I could hear a distant musical note but not see the instrument.  For I was in the tunnels deep below the earth, in one of the few remaining coal mines, and shielded from the radiance above.  My team stiffened at midnight, casting their eyes upwards, searching the rock, their eyes finding nothing against the stone and support beams.  And at six AM, we boarded the mine shaft, each of us stopping at the time clock to claim our hours.\n\nThat was when the cell phones started to buzz.\n\nDeep underground, it\'s impossible for the signal to penetrate.  You\'re cut off not only from the sky, but from all life.  All humanity.  And now, just a few dozen feet below the surface, the flood began.\n\nJim\'s phone started first, the ringtone not changed in over a decade, his wrinkles deepening as he stared at the screen.  In all the time I had known Jim, I\'d never heard that ringtone.  I\'d never seen his screen light up, or his fingers peddle across a keyboard that still used T-9.  But now, the device wouldn\'t stop vibrating long enough for him to type an answer.\n\nSally\'s went off next- Sally, who\'s screen was so cracked that is nearly cut her finger as she swiped, and who had added a case thicker than her hard hat as a countermeasure to future damage.  But the damage was already done, and no case could undo it.  Funny, how she didn\'t protect it until no longer necessary.  Like her husband, who cheated on her after they fought every night for a month, and now she spread mortar over the cracks in a marriage that would never recover.\n\nMy phone, at four percent battery, was last.  As the twenty other miners trickled out of the tunnel, I switched off airplane mode, which I had been on to connect keep it from dying.  I\'d been saving it to call my own wife- it had been six months since our last date, but little Jimmy was sleeping over at a friends tonight.  And I\'d been saving change for weeks to take her to Gianno\'s, where we had first met, to share a Chicago pizza.  Maybe even a milkshake after, if we could splurge.\n\nBut before I could call, my phone also started to vibrate.  And four percent turned to three percent.\n\nFrom Jimmy. ""Dad, you HAVE to see this!  Meet me at the baseball field!""\n\nFrom my wife.  ""Honey, come home soon, let\'s stay in the garden and look at the stars.""\n\nThree percent turned to two percent.\n\nFrom Amanda, my college girlfriend. ""Hi Jacob, I know it\'s been years since we last talked, but I just wanted to apologize for being a bitch when we broke up.  Not that you weren\'t a jerk :)  But anyways, if you\'re looking for some fun, let\'s take a walk in the park.  Maybe we can hide in the bushes :)""\n\nFrom the astronomy club I had went to once, who kept my phone number since last September. ""Jacob, you will *not* believe what\'s in the sky.  You don\'t need a telescope to see this!""\n\nTwo percent became one, and my phone began to wail.  It was like one of those Amber alerts, where a child goes missing, and you\'re supposed to watch for a license plate.  But this message contained neither a child or plate.\n\nI\'d been walking as I read the messages, but now I stopped, the rest of the group exiting twenty yards ahead of me into the moonlight.  I could hear their phones wailing as well, but none bothered to look.  Instead, they looked up, while I looked down.\n\n""STAY INSIDE.  HIDE, LOCK YOUR DOORS, AND AWAIT EMERGENCY SERVICES.""\n\nBut when I blinked, the message changed while the phone refreshed.\n\n""UNLOCK YOUR DOORS, AND AWAIT EMERGENCY SERVICES OUTSIDE.""\n\nThe screen turned dark as the last remaining trickle of battery failed, and the lights in the tunnel flickered.  Ahead, glancing at the reflecting moonlight, something tugged at my mind.  A distant memory that seemed like a word on the tip of my tongue.  An excitement, a mission, something calling to me.  A terrible purpose.\n\nI swallowed, then looked back towards the group.  Their heads tilted back, and their mouths opened, their pupils dilating despite the light.  Their shoulders turned rigid and they stood on their tip toes as their voices cut through the night, as they shouted into the sky.  But I edged backwards into the darkness as they sprinted away together, as a pack.  I slept there that night, waiting for daylight, the mine echoing with the sound they had made before leaving and making me shake.\n\nThey have remembered the howl.\n\nAnd with the rising sun, I walk among wolves.\n\n***\n\n\n\nBy Leo\n\n**[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/8ag0co/the_howl_part_2_its_3_am_an_official_phone_alert/)**', ""Andrew nearly snarled as his phone chimed for what seemed to be the umpteenth time. His shift at the warehouse ended only a few hours ago and it like chickens running around with their heads chopped off whenever he left. It was rare delight to encounter the nights that he was actually permitted to sleep through the night.\n\nOn top of the texts that were just brimming with simple incompetency, the morons that lit up his phone in the middle of the night always seemed to wake up his wife, Isabel, who suffered from insomnia to begin with. The raise Andrew agreed to that stated he kept his ringer on for these occasions never seemed worth it when he saw Isabel the next day, curled up in the guest room with dark circles under her eyes from her attempts to get away from the constant chiming. \n\nAndrew rubbed a hand over eyes to clear them, trying to understand the ridiculous amount of messages but he must have been more tired than he thought since they didn‚Äôt make sense.\n\nHe quickly scrolled through the message previews, finding they all seemed to follow the same pattern: to look at the moon. The moon? What the -? Why?\n\nIt was like a shot to his adrenaline when he saw that some of the messages were coming from Isabel‚Äôs phone. He shot up from bed, seeing the other side empty, and jumped to his feet. \n\n‚ÄúHun, what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù Andrew questioned, still scrolling through his phone while walking towards the guest room.  The room was at the end of the hallway and the door was wide open. He could see Isabel standing in the middle of the room, arms down by her side and phone clutched in her hand as she gazed out the window. \n\nAs he grew closer, he could see that she was shaking, ‚ÄúBel? Honey? What‚Äôs wrong, why-‚Äù\n\nIsabel‚Äôs body whipped toward him and Andrew couldn‚Äôt help himself, he froze in place. She ran and shoved her body into the door, slamming it shut and locking it in place. \n\nThe speed was all wrong though, Andrew had never seen her move that fast. It was insane, it was...inhuman‚Ä¶.\n\nHis own body started to tremble when he remembered her eyes. Her pupils were dilated and not a single bit of the green irises he loved so much were left. \n\nHe was just about to ram his own body into the door, to beg her to let him in and make her explain what is happening, but then she started sobbing. \n\n‚ÄúAndrew! You need to run, you need to hide! I‚Äôm so sorry, god I am so sorry. Run, Andrew, and whatever you do, don‚Äôt look at the moon!‚Äù \n\nAndrew started pounding his fists on the door and trying to shove his weight against it, but she must have blocked it with something. \n\nDespite his shouting and his pleading to be let in, his forgotten phone on the hallway floor seemed to crack through the commotion as the alarms of the emergency alert system distracted him for just a moment. The robotic voice started to play from his phone automatically, ‚ÄúWARNING. THIS IS NOT A TEST. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT. DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON. WARNING. THIS IS NOT A TES-‚Äù\n\nAndrew thought his distress was at its peak, nothing was making sense and he just needed to get Isabel so they could deal with this together. He just needed to-\n\nHer screams started and it struck him cold to the very center of his being. He began pounding and kicking at the door until it gave way under his body. Isabel was on the floor, writhing in the moonlight. Andrew couldn‚Äôt help it, his knees buckled and he emptied the contents of his stomach right where he stood. \n\nIsabel's body was bent at every wrong angle possible but she wasn‚Äôt screaming anymore. Her head snapped in his direction with that ungodly speed again. Bathed in the moon‚Äôs light and pupils still completely dilated, she smiled up at him as if every bone in her body wasn‚Äôt broken. \n\nIn the same voice she used to tell soothe him time after time, she whispered, ‚ÄúLook at the moon, Andrew.‚Äù \n"", 'I didn\'t really know what to think of it. ""Don\'t look at the moon""? Sure, no problem. Going back to sleep now. But then I saw my other notifications...99+? Ok, something is definitely up.\n\nI tried to call my girlfriend, but I notice one of the texts I got was from her. ""You really should go look at the moon, its amazing."" I flip on the tele to see if there\'s any coverage on what the hell is going on but it just says its off the air. Flip to another channel, same thing. Ok, I\'m starting to freak out about this point. Get my laptop, check out Reddit, everything on r/all is urging people to look at the moon. \n\nI try to call my parents, my sister, my friends, no answer from any of them. I\'m sitting on the floor with my knees tucked under my chin, rocking slightly back and forth. There\'s a part of me that just wants to run outside and stare upwards, give in to the madness. Somehow I repress that urge. Then I notice something strange.\n\nThe window. It\'s twenty til 4 but the light coming in through the window is getting more intense. I watch the pale beams stream in, casting an eerie glow into the room. Moonlight doesn\'t look like that. Moonlight *can\'t* look like that. I closed my eyes real tight. I began to cry.\n\nI waited. I sat there on the floor, crying like a child, hiding from the unnatural light under the covers. My blanket was thick, yet the cruel light kept peaking through the threads. I began to hyperventilate. The closeness of my breath under the blanket was hard to bear but I did not dare uncover myself for air. I tried to distract myself with my phone, checked for updates, tried to get a hold of anyone, but to no avail. Still the same messages over and over, tempting me. \'Just a couple of hours and the sun will come up. Then I\'ll be safe.\' I thought to myself. \n\n2 hours later. Dawn had not come.\n\n3 hours later. Dawn had not come.\n\nI risked a small opening of the cover so I could look at the room. Not only had the light intensified, it now seemed to engulf my room in a maddening pale light. Presently I became aware of a constant humming. I listened to try and identify the source, but it was unlike anything I had heard before. Like the whir of some inhuman machinery. My mind began to race. I cried out for someone, *anyone* to come and save me, to end this nightmare. But no one came.\n\nI lay there on my floor, in a state bordering madness for another 5 hours. After the 3rd hour I began to babble to myself. With every hour the whir seemed to get louder and closer, my room was now light up like a movie set. I maneuvered myself under the bed but the vile light had stolen the shadows from even there! \n\nThroughout the day the urge to uncover myself and run laughing and screaming into the streets grew stronger and I had to stop myself from jumping up at regular intervals. The whir was now being accompanied by a constant \'thrumming\' which preyed my weakened sanity.  \n\nI like to believe that I lasted longer than anyone else, in the end.\n\nI began to beat my head against the floor, in an attempt to shut out the unceasing noise. Eventually I was slamming it so hard I believe I gave myself a concussion. \n\nI couldn\'t take it anymore. All at once I wriggled out from under the bed in my cocoon, threw the blankets off of me and darted out my door. I ran down the hallway where even *here* the light had spread itself, even in a place *with no windows*. Down the stairs and up to the front door, I nearly tore it off its hinges on my way out. \n\nWell it wasn\'t a moon.\n\nThe eyes are what gave it away.\n\nThough they were right...it really was quite beautiful.\n\n\n<If you actually read this whole thing, thank you. I don\'t write these at all but there was something about this one that got my brain flowing.>', 'I wake to my phone buzzing on the night stand. I look at the clock next to it. The green numbers shine brightly: 3:14 AM.\n\n\'What the hell?\' I think to myself. \'Why is anyone texting me at 3 in the morning?\'\n\nBefore I can take a look, it starts buzzing again. And again. It won\'t stop. I grab the phone and mute it quickly but the notifications continue to pop up silently. ""It\'s a beautiful night tonight. Look outside."" They\'re texts coming from my mother, my friends, my siblings, even some numbers I don\'t recognize.\n\nAn unfamiliar alarm blares on my phone. A new notification pops up on my phone, titled US Government Emergency Alert. It reads ""DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.""\n\n\'This is weird,\' I think to myself, \'What the hell could be wrong with the moon?\'\n\nI walk to my window. I carefully open the curtains halfway so the moon is still covered. The sight is incredible.\n\nAlmost all of my neighbors are standing outside, phone in hand. They\'re staring upward in the direction of the moon. They\'re walking around talking to each other, pointing to the sky.\n\n\'I gotta see what the hell is going on.\'\n\nI walk outside and jog over next door, carefully keeping my eyes lowered. My neighbour is standing by his door. I\'m about to call out to him when he interrupts me. \n\n""Hey! Have you seen the moon tonight?"" he asks.\n\n""Listen man, something weird is going on. It\'s 3 in the morning, why are you outside right now? Why is half the neighbourhood outside?"" I reply.\n\n""You haven\'t looked yet, have you?"" he laughs.\n\n""Did you just ignore everything I said? Why are you outside? What\'s wrong with the moon?""\n\nWithout warning, my neighbor rushes up to me and places a hand on each side of my head. He violently turns my head toward the sky. ""Just look!""\n\nOh. OH. I get it now. This is... incredible. It\'s impossible. There\'s no way this can be happening. It\'s... I don\'t even know. I have to tell someone about this. \n\nI take out my phone and draft a message, addressed to everyone on my contact list. I slowly tap in the words ""It\'s a beautiful night tonight. Look outside."" \n\n', '[removed]', 'My hand reached out from the messy nest of blankets I was buried under, and flopped onto the buzzing phone on my dresser. Bleary-eyed and dazed, I dragged it under the blankets with me, refusing to let myself be fully roused from a solid nights sleep. ""What the fuck,"" I muttered to myself, nearly mumbling the words out loud. \n\nWith a pained squint of too much brightness far too suddenly, I looked at the screen and saw - jesus, had to be hundreds of notifications, at least. Which was weird enough; me getting messages from 100+ people? Not enough people like me for that to be a common occurrence. But weirder still was they all said the same exact thing, ""It\'s a beautiful night tonight. Look outside."" Bitches, it\'s basically morning, I thought. But before I could move, let alone shake the cozy cocoon of blankets from my head to look out my window and see what could possibly be so damn beautiful, my phone buzzed again.\n\nI practically jumped as it shocked my hand. There was a new message, but this one said something different, ""DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON."" ""What?"" This time I actually did speak out loud. Frustration now fully replaced by curiosity and a racing heart, I kicked the blankets off and staggered down the hall to my roommates bedroom. \n\n""Mon?"" I called, knocking on her closed door. Mon was short for Monica. We had only been roommates for a short time - me, in desperate need of a new apartment, and her, with a newly empty house gifted by her parents - but friends for about a year. There was no answer. I tried again, ""Mon? You up?"" I shivered, which was odd. Sure, I was dressed only in a long tee shirt but it had been spring for weeks now; it should have been enough to feel warm in this house. I heard a loud THUD and bang from inside Monica\'s room. ""Monica? Are you okay?"" When still there was no answer, I threw open the door.\n\nThere was Monica, hanging from the light fixture. Her heavy wooden desk stool lay toppled on the floor beneath her. ""Oh my god!"" I screamed, ""Monica!"" I raced to her feet, held them, grabbed the stool and placed them under her feet. But her body had gone extraordinarily limp in such a short time. Phone in hand, I called 911. Busy signal. What? How...I pulled the phone away from my ear, my other arm still wrapped around Monica\'s ice cold legs. The blaring sound seemed to fill the air as I tried to comprehend how this could be possible. All right, no problem, let\'s try again, I thought, swallowing hard and trying not to shake. Busy signal, again. What the hell could be happening, I thought, feeling the stirrings of real panic start to fill my body. \n\nThere was a TV in Monica\'s room. I gingerly placed Monica\'s feet on the table, then ran to grab the remote sitting on her night table. I clicked, and my eyes were suddenly swimming in the bright colors and video of New Channel One. Almost instantly, I felt my knees buckle from under me. ""Sources are reporting a sweep of suicides all over the nation,"" the newscaster was saying in a somber and serious tone. Her blood red lipstick matched her blazer as she went on, mouth uttering words that made me believe this all could only be a dream. ""911 is overwhelmed with floods of calls. Police called to hundreds upon thousands of scenes of jumpers immediately shot themselves upon looking upward. No one is quite yet sure as to what the correlation might be-"" \n\nI turned away from the tv, staring down at the phone in my hand. I looked over to Monica\'s desk and picked up her phone. She too, had hundreds of the ""look outside"" texts. But the one she didn\'t have - the warning not to look at the moon. \n\nMy breath grew ragged, shallow, as I scrolled through her notifications and could not find a warning anywhere. And all I could think was: why me?\'', '######[](#dropcap)\n\nIt was one of those surreal moments that you only get to experience once in life.\n\nLinda was working on the script for the next show when her phone began to buzz. Slowly at first, just a couple messages. Work friends, she thought. Thursday was always their night out for drinks, but she had been too busy tonight to join them. \n\nThen the buzzing became more rapid, until her phone began vibrating constantly on the bed. With a frown, she glanced at the messages that were popping up quickly, one after another. They were all from random numbers, all sending the exact same message. She scrolled through, just to make sure she wasn\'t missing something. \n\n""It\'s a beautiful night tonight. Look outside."" \n\nA frisson of fear ran down her spine. After a minute, the messages slowed down. Then a singular message, different from the previous ones. \n\n""DO NOT LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW."" \n\nIt was from her boyfriend, Jordan. Her mind reeled. This had to be some kind of joke. She\'d been such a good girl. She never went to abandoned houses and never walked into creepy forests alone. She was always sure to lock her windows and doors at night. \n\nSo with hesitant steps, she walked toward the dark curtain that was covering her window. Slowly, she reached out a hand and flicked off the lamp on her desk so that her room became pitch dark. It would help, at least, if whatever was out there couldn\'t see in. Then, she slowly slid open the curtain and peeked outside, expecting the worst. Perhaps a killer clown or a ghost.\n\nShe squinted. Was that...Jordan? \n\nWithout hesitating, she ran toward her bedroom door, throwing it open, and dashed down the steps of her apartment until she was at the bottom. There, she watched as her boyfriend was desperately trying to bring down the small hot air balloon that he had somehow managed to raise a little ways from her window. \n\nHe glanced down at her, then ducked into the basket. She simply stood there, waiting for him to get down. When the balloon came close enough, she saw the sign plastered to the front, and burst out into laughter. \n\nOn the front of the balloon, in large bold, flowery lettering, were the words: \n\nLINDA, WILL YOU MARY ME? \n\nWhen the hot air balloon touched down, Jordan climbed out, his face bunched up. ""I told them not to send the messages, but it was too late when I noticed the typo--I\'m going to kill Erin by the way--and everyone has such quick reflexes-"" \n\nLinda simply laughed and cut him off, throwing herself into his arms. ""The answer\'s yes, in case you were wondering."" \n\nJordan froze for a moment before he hugged her tight, lifting her up and spinning her around in the air. Then, huffing and puffing, he set her down, breaking out in a large smile as he gazed her windswept hair and freckles. ""Best girlfriend ever,"" he said softly. \n\n""Best fianc√©e ever,"" she corrected, and tilted his face so they could look at the moon together. ""You have great timing, by the way. It\'s a full moon tonight."" \n\n""I meant to do that,"" he said, and kissed her on the forehead. Then he pulled out his phone. \n\n""Mission success,"" he typed into the group chat, and ignored the kissy faces that flooded in. He would get revenge on Erin tomorrow, he vowed, his face dark. But at least, he thought, this would be a tale to tell the grandkids. \n\n***** \n\nr/AlannaWu', 'I‚Äôm lying in a bed on a tuesday night.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm having restless dreams.\n\nAnd then I awake from a story where I‚Äôm rescuing a princess from a wheel of cheese.

Everybody else was outside looking at the moon, or sleeping all day wherever they last witnessed the moon.. \n\nTritanopia is a form of color blindness that reduces the blue/yellow/green portion of the spectrum. \n\nUs lucky one in ten thousand were unphased by the moon... Get it? Moon puns. \n\nFor reference,\n1:10,000 expands to \n100,000:1,000,000,000\n\nAnd there\'s seven some billion people total, so you\'d think seven hundred thousand people would be able to coordinate.\n\nBut then you have to look at population densities, distributive models of where tritanopia can be found, how difficult it is to travel when almost everyone is standing in the middle of the road to quietly worship the moon. \n\nImagine being at a festival with a target audience of docile septuagenarians. You don\'t like the grateful dead, don\'t get why\neveryone is fixated, just want the whole thing to end. You try making a call on your phone but it just plays Phish songs  That\'s how it felt. \n\nIt\'s like not being a hockey fan in Canada. \n\nSo. 700,000 functioning humans remaining. All ages. All ability levels. The vast majority lacking applicable skills or the psychological tenacity required to face this world.  I was only 12 when it happened, just on the cusp of being forged by the new world yet with fond memories of the old ways.\n\nMost animals that could look up and had some visual acuity also became enraptured. I wanted to help the animals but I didn\'t know how. \n\nMy first two days I tried to go about my routine as normal. Except there was no more no normal routine. No supply lines, no infrastructure, no social contract. Ran into a lot of lunatic strangers that got a start on the hoarding and mad max fashion early. My family had a close personal bond with either the moon or stolen wholesale liquor, depending on sight abilities. \n\nA tritanopia support myphp forum briefly assembled IRL and tried to stage a coup of world power, but taking over the white house and the UN when there really isn\'t anyone to enforce your will doesn\'t matter much. Nobody to answer the phone for the nuclear launch codes, nobody to pop in the 8.5"" floppy disks to get the nukes into the sky. Infighting led to the fast dissolution of that group, especially when the yahoo group insurrectionists gained traction. \n\nThe moonies just stopped participating. Beat them up, bash them to death in the streets, run them over. No resistance. Just single most minded dedication to the moon. A sadist\'s mcplayland. \n\nThey didn\'t eat or drink but they didn\'t die of exposure or dehydration. After a while their skin became ashy during the day.  They went from monosyllabic grunts to utter silence.\n\nA bit later, some of them grew wings or horns or scales . Some grew hair and became funky werewolf-gargoyle things. \n\nThe transformed congregation moved in packs but continued to stare at the moon. They\'d only respond if provoked but you\'d be dead before you realized you had provoked them. \n\nThen came the Sound Eternal. Somewhere between Gregorian chanting, Cthulhu summoning , and Tibetan throat singing. Constant, from sun down to sun up. From the beasts, from the people. \n\nIt was declared cured five or six times. Half of those just lies from crumbling provisional government. The other half lacked real testing or distribution standards. Giving injections to hoards of swaying gnarly mutants that may lead to heads exploding one way or another wasn\'t going to work out \n\nAnd so modified aerial viruses delivered via crop dusters, foggers, modified tear gas canisters, anything that could contain the smoke. \n\n They all cocooned out for a bit after the dusting misused some lies masquerading as legitimate research.\n\nI saw the aftermath and heard the confessions but I can\'t tell you in great detail how that all went down. Too busy rhen with the fight for survival, a sixteen year old keeping a nuclear reactor running on a submarine turned makeshift unethical medical experimentation laboratory.\n\nThe less said, the better. Dark time for submarines. \n\nMost Moonies came out of chrysalis fit as a fiddle, back to full health, lost all the medieval art features. \n\nLived a mockery of their old routines, spring in their step.

Probably not the most rational decision that could\'ve been made, but after surviving weregargoyles the social fabric didn\'t have much space for rationality. \n\nThey\'d peruse ransacked grocery stores, exchange idle  moon-themed pleasantries with each other. Morning jog through fields of corpses, oblivious. Flip.through the same old magazine until it disintergrated. Barbers and janitors would go to rubble that used to be their workplace and sweep with purposelessness . Tradesmen could sort of resume their jobs, more or less,  but only served their own kind. After a few months, they used noise singing to gather a crowd and coordinate at a task, building ungodly architecture overnight or sacrificing a hundred mile long line of people to send an electrical signal from one necropolis to the next. \n\nThey\'d all look at us and they would know. They would say ""better not look at the moon"" in the same deadpan attempt of reverse psychology.  I\'d reply ""What a beautiful night out"" while bug eyed stating at their moon. And sing about the moon hitting my eye like a big pizza pie. They just didn\'t understand thar moon magic wouldn\'t work on my snarky 19 year old deficient peepers. I had fallen into a bad crowd of pharmaceutic redistributors.\n\nI\'lll admit I developed a bit of a moon dust habit.The dust made their late 20th century satire of mid 20th century values schtick a little more tolerable. What else is there to do during the longest flash mob installation art piece? Swap rumors and lies about how places beyond the horizon were getting by?\n\nSomeone - nobody knows which side - invented glasses that compensated for the color blindness, let the impure finally join the teeming masses. That caught on big once we realized us last few unchanged had successfully flushed all chance of rebuilding or becoming something other than marauder junkies. I was around 22 at the time and in middle of trying to preserve priceless irreplaceable cultural artifacts from the Smithsonian, mostly by defending an adjacent outpost and running a little mercantile ammo shop on the side. Missed out on the suicide sunglasses phase. Gave away the only pair I stumbled across in the ruins to a real go-getter errand runner. \n\nThen, next phase began and their molting started. Human skin left lying around everywhere, giant insectoid snakemen picking fights, the usual. Moondust purity went way down, market nearly tanked. By then I had a cybernetic arm and a laser eye. I spent most of my time in pipes, guarding various keys and providing clues to riddles. \n\nI betrayed everyone that trusted me at every turn and regret nothing. I had once decided to live like a forgettable side quest NPC in a sub-par video game series. But when the laser eye was installed, I could see the full beauty of the moon in all spectrums, even those invisible to the limited human eye.\n\nDidn\'t take long to round up the remaining twenty thousand some for free laser eye replacement. There\'s some logistics, sure, but you concentrate everyone into  camps, chop off some limbs, erase the notion of free will or anything but service to the moon.\n\nTurns out the moon does not mind if you scoop out significant portions of the prefrontal lobe before conversion. The question is will you be complacent enough to realize your higher calling or are you going to be another meat log for the stumpy field? \n\nEither way, the implants will a little itch bit at first.

I gripped my phone on one hand and on the other my bed sheets. A deafening silence filled my bed room. \n\n""What the fuck?"" I murmured to myself. I rose up to a sitting position, used the now dirty bed sheet to clean my face. ""Sarah?"" I called out to my wife. Only silence answered my question. I ripped the sheets from my form and lunged out of bed.\n\n""Sarah!"" I screamed. I ran out the bedroom, down the hall, and entered the living room. ""Sarah?!"" I yelled out once more. My eyes glanced about the room, scoutted the kitchen, peer to the old leathery couch but found nothing. \n\nI fox walked in darkness using the surface floor to fix my location.

I gathered whatever wits I had, which wasn\'t much to begin with and slowly walked to the other side of the room. Pale white blinds decorated the door in front of me. I swallowed empty dread that filled my mouth.\n\n\n\nI gently pull open the door.\n\n\n\n\nSarah stood outside, standing on the soft green grass. Her back faced me.

My hands shook and my breathing quickened. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe moon floated above. Far bigger then it should have. Markings scarred it\'s surface like crude cross hatched shading. The lines grew and within the crevasses poured out blood. I was paralyzed. I couldn\'t look away. Not when the blood finished covering it. Not when the latitudes and longitudes pulled away from the center and revealed what was hidden inside. A humanoid beast. Its skin paled skin matched that of the moon. It\'s arms pulled away from its legs and oriented itself upwards. Its face simply consisted of 7 eyes. The remains of the moon orbit around the beast. Faster and faster they moved, until they were blur. The beast opened its eyes and the pieces began to glow.  Spears, they began to distort and change and took the forms of glowing spears.\n\nMillions of miles away from Earth. Threw the empty void of space. The shafts of light flew.\n\nEach Longinus struck true and with  the impact millions of people were turned to their basic components. Primordial soup poured into valleys, flowed into rivers, flooded homes. Their souls however stayed where they once stood, whirled and moved and solidified into perfect red spheres. \n\nThe spheres shot up towards the sky and stopped once the swarm overlooked the Earth.\n\nThat day humanity vanished and the beast that screamed from the center of its egg feasted.\n\n\n***\n\nI\'m very sorry for any errors.

""Good advice."" I turned off my phone, rolled over, and drifted back to sleep.\n\nThe next day, I was stunned to discover the horrible truth of what those messages were really about: a guerilla marketing stunt by Sony Pictures for some stupid horror movie about a moon cult using cell phones to murder people. Unfortunately, it had caused a ""War of the Worlds""-type panic, and the resulting lawsuits all but obliterated the studio. But on the plus side, the rights to Spider-Man defaulted over to Marvel Studios and now there could never be a Pixels 2, so it was all kind of a wash in the end.', 'I toss in my sleep-- there\'s a loud buzzing ringing in my left ear, and my eyes flicker open to reveal my phone: vibrating with it\'s receivance of hundreds of messages.

Without a few seconds of  effort, my phone is back on silent, and the buzzing stops. I go back the fuck to bed. The creepypasta bullshit can wait, I\'m tired as shit.', 'DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.\n\nMy eyes were barely open, bleary with sleep, but the incessant buzzing of the phone against the glossy black wood of the bedside table was just passing the point of ignorable.  It took me a moment to register that the words were strange, holding their place at the top of the screen in bold, official letters, while the green icons of text messages scrolled beneath.\n\nDo not look at the moon?  What the hell kind of late April Fool‚Äôs joke was this?  I scoffed quietly, glancing down over the stream of messages. Moon shit, moon shit, and‚Ä¶ moon shit.  Whatever.  Had to be some kind of gag, and frankly, I didn‚Äôt have the goddamn time for it.  Work came early in the morning, and I had‚Ä¶ what, two hours left before I had to wake up in order to beat traffic?\n\nFuck this.  I powered the phone off to quiet the buzzing, and dropped my hands down to rest on my chest, phone still resting beneath.  And with the screen out of my line of sight, that was when I noticed her.\n\nMy wife was a beautiful woman-- The sort of beautiful that comes after a good decade of married life.  That kind of beautiful with a few lines around the eyes, and a few strands of stray silver in her dark hair.  Not that I could see them from where she was, standing silhouetted by the streaming moonlight pouring in the window, her hands resting lightly on the glass.\n\n‚ÄúAnna?‚Äù came my groggy mumble of a voice.\n\nNo response.  She just stood there, staring upwards in the bath of silvery light.  Was the moon always this bright?  Or had I just never really noticed it before?\n\n‚ÄúAnna, c‚Äômere,‚Äù I said a little louder, reaching out a heavy hand towards her and dropping it back down onto the sheets.\n\nNothing.\n\nConcern slowly began to stir somewhere in my gut as I stared at her familiar outline.  I could see the dust in the air, floating lazily in the shafts of moonlight that her body eclipsed.  Her nightgown wasn‚Äôt sheer, but as awareness began to settle in on my suddenly very awake mind, I realized the light was shining straight through.  That was far, far too bright for moonlight.\n\nAnd that was when she turned her head, the movement just a little too slow, too smooth.  In the perfect, bald light I could see her face.  So familiar, with those smile lines around her lips, even with the neutral blank of her expression.  Her dark brows lifted over eyes familiar in shape, even if the harsh shadows made them look like strange, blackened pits.  And then she finally looked at me.  I knew she looked at me.  It was unmistakable with the way her pupils reflected the moonlight, like some nocturnal hunting cat.\n\nHer lips parted and she whispered, her soft voice clear.\n\n‚ÄúThe moon-- it‚Äôs beautiful tonight.  Come look.\n', 'I refused. It was hard, but I refused. Hundreds of notifications pouring in, telling me to look at the moon but I didn‚Äôt.\n\nSomething seemed weirdly off by the idea of hundreds telling me to look at a rock in the sky and I‚Äôve never gotten this many notifications before so I simply refused to do what they said. Plus I‚Äôd gotten an alert to not look at the moon and I trusted my alert rather than whoever was sending me all these messages. I decided to keep my curtains closed and just went to bed. \n\nThe next morning my suspicions seemed correct. When I woke up there was no one around and the streets were completely empty, no kids playing even though it was Saturday, no one driving through the street, no one even outside.\nI had no idea what was happening but I kept on going.\n\nEventually I arrived at work to find that no one was there either but I was a loyal employee and did my job anyway. I worked at a local fast food restaurant which was owned by my granddaddy before he passed and passed onto my father, he‚Äôs was on his last legs too though.\n\nNo one even came in so I just sat there in total isolation, I checked all my social media to find everyone was posting the same damn thing. ‚ÄúLook at the moon.‚Äù\n\nI decided I might get answers at towns centre so I began driving there to find crashed cars everywhere but no bodies. There were other irregularities like smashed windows, crashed busses, upturned taxis, even an irregular amount of stray cats and dogs.\n\nEventually I arrived at the town centre where the clock tower was. What I saw was terrifying. Nearly the entire town was surrounding the tower staring up at the sky. I approached and tried to get one of the crowd member‚Äôs attention, I recognised him as he sometimes came into the restaurant with his son, I think his name was jack or John or something. I said his name and shook him a little bit he wouldn‚Äôt break eye contact with the moon. That‚Äôs when I realised, the moon must have made them catatonic.\n\nI ran back to my car and turned on the radio, trying to think of what to do until I heard a radio transmission by some guy.\n\n‚ÄúHello? Hello? If you are not hypnotised in what we here at the station are calling the ‚Äòlunar effect.‚Äô Then please come to these coordinates. We need to figure this out, as far as we can tell 90% of the population are under the influence of the ‚Äòlunar effect.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThen it was followed by some coordinates. I turned on my gps and began driving. What was happening?', 'It was called *Fuck You* money, the type of money you burn in front of poor people just to see the hope fade from their eyes. It was the type of money you used to hire the most expensive prostitutes in America, tell them to pretend to be bankers, and have them meet for lunch in *Le Bernardin* in the heart of Manhattan. Each thought they were meeting a client, both were told to never break act.\n\nI sat at the table next to theirs, twirling a stainless steel pen with the letters *Goldman Sachs* gilded on. The girl, Anna, was the first to arrive. A tight black skirt hugged her figure. The skirt was short, but work-appropriate short. She was the best prostitute *Fuck You* money could buy which meant she was the best in the world. She turned her wrist and checked a silver Rolex. It was a Daytona model. She had certainly done her research.\n\nThe guy, Brandon, soon followed. He wore a navy blue suit without a single crinkle. I glanced down at his shoes. Brooks Brothers, custom-made. It looked hand-crafted even. A smile touched my lips as he sat down and extended his hand for a handshake.\n\n‚ÄúAnna, was it?‚Äù Brandon said. ‚ÄúThanks for meeting me, my name‚Äôs Brandon, VP at JPMorgan Chase, housing division.‚Äù\n\nAnna returned him a firm shake. ‚ÄúNice to meet you. I‚Äôm a VP at Merrill Lynch, risk division.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLook at us, if our bosses found us here. They‚Äôd have our bonuses.‚Äù\n\nShe laughed and took a sip of wine. ‚ÄúSo, I was told that you had a business proposal for me?‚Äù\n\nThis was it, the reason I had dropped five figures on two prostitutes. Brandon would fumble through banking buzz words and financial pseudo-sciences as I sat back, laughing at his stupidity. Then Anna would follow in their dance of idiocrasy, all the way until they left *La Bernadin*, never to return because they couldn‚Äôt afford even its dress code. My pen twirled in anticipation.\n\n‚ÄúCredit default swaps,‚Äù Brandon said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs insurance against bad loans. So if we make a string of bad investments, even when we lose, we make money, just not as much.‚Äù\n\nAnna furrowed her brow. ‚ÄúI work risk at Merrill Lynch, I know how to lower risk.‚Äù\n\nA giggle tickled my throat. What would a prostitute know about credit default swaps? He probably read the first Wikipedia paragraph and now thought himself an expert. I wondered who would be the bigger idiot, Brandon or Anna?\n\n‚ÄúWhat if we pair that up with thousands of high-risk loans?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLike we already do?‚Äù Anna asked.\n\n‚ÄúBut not *individually*.‚Äù Brandon leaned forward, his voice lowered so I had to strain my ears just to hear his words. ‚ÄúWe pool them all together and then securitize them into a single asset. Tell me Anna, what happens when you bundle risk?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt drops,‚Äù Anna said. ‚ÄúBut those have been around for a while now. Are you proposing that we just keep doing what we‚Äôre doing?‚Äù\n\nBrandon frowned. It looked like Anna had done more research than him. I pretended to cough to stifle my laughter. It was he who would look the fool!\n\n‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Anna said, ‚Äúbut how about we talk to the ratings agencies. The bigger the pool of assets, the lower the risk. If we get a big enough pool, any sort of shitty asset could have a triple-A rating.‚Äù\n\nMy jaw dropped and I broke character by staring straight at her. The two didn‚Äôt even notice, they were so buried in their conversation.\n\n‚ÄúWe can lower it further by having it asset-backed. Like a car loan,‚Äù Brandon said, his voice rising with his excitement.\n\n‚ÄúLike a mortgage!‚Äù Anna said. ‚ÄúWe can sell janitors million dollar houses on loans they‚Äôll never pay off, pool all those loans together, and then sell them off as a Triple-A asset before they crash and burn.‚Äù\n\nMy fingers trembled, but not with the same excitement I had purchased. They were right. Banks could securitize all these shitty mortgages and their value would rise because their ratings would, even though the risk technically stayed exactly the same. My pen dropped to the napkin in front of me and I wrote a single phrase into it before slipping it in my pocket and leaving.\n\n*Sub-prime mortgages.*\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for daily WP stories, continuations by popular demand, and more!', '""Oh...hey Daryl,"" the lady said, with slight surprise, but more a sense of boredom in her voice.\n\n""Hey Judy. This again, huh?"" Daryl replied.\n\n""Yep. Well, we may as well make the best of it,"" said Judy, putting on a brave face.\n\n""For sure. Okay...soo...how are those reports going?"" Daryl said, in his best banker voice.\n\n""Not bad, although Bill pulled me into a meeting all afternoon, so I got pretty sidetracked,"" replied Judy, starting to get into character.\n\n""Jeez, Bill again huh?""\n\n""Ya, he means well, and he\'s a pleasant guy to work for overall, but he wastes *so* much time in meetings. It\'s like... we get it, we\'re all on board with the \'Bank Mission Statement\', but we have to get some work done too,"" Judy said - her mind now switching fully into her bank character.\n\n*This is fucking sweet.* I thought to myself.\n\n""Totally. I mean, I like teamwork, respect and honesty as much as the next guy, but most managers just leave it as a background thing,"" said Daryl, starting to enjoy himself.\n\nJudy caught a little smile from Daryl, and a twinkle in his eye. *Well,* she thought, *I have to say, this is definitely more fun than that wizard scenario I was in last week...*\n\nDaryl was thinking the same thing, *Not bad compared to the ant farm lady. My ant character blows...I just can\'t get into it.*\n\n""Next time Bill calls a meeting I think I\'m gonna say something,"" Judy continued. ""Nothing rude, but I just feel like we\'re wasting so much time in that little boardroom. I mean, *at least* try to book the big one with the lake view.""\n\n""That lake one is dope...I could totally spend an afternoon in there,"" replied Daryl, nodding his head.\n\n*This is amazing,* I thought to myself, barely holding it together.\n\n""Have you ever been in the meeting room on the top floor, near Thompson\'s office?"" Judy asked, picturing it in vivid detail.\n\n""Don\'t stop,"" I whispered, too quietly for anyone to hear.\n\n""Oh my God, if that was my office I would be so fucking productive. Jesus Christ, just think of all the work I could get done in there,"" said Daryl, with genuine excitement.\n\n""What an awesome meeting room,"" agreed Judy, shaking her head in near disbelief.\n\nBoth Judy and Daryl had dove in head first. They knew the bank inside and out. They knew who they liked at the bank and who they didn\'t. They embodied the bank\'s Core Values, and had a list of who they could fire if the budget got tight. They had fulfilled the role. \n\nAnd most importantly. \n\nThey had truly \n\nbecome... \n\n*Bankers*.\n\n*Ohmygodimcumming*\n', '\nThe coverlet stuck to my skin wherever it touched. It looked to be fine silk, ordinarily sewn, though nothing was what it seemed in La Silhouette. The vintage of the wine in the adjoining restaurant, let alone the year stamped into the stones along the exterior, were more a charade of luxury than the real thing. This was the kind of place your brought an escort on a budget, in your suit of fine polyesters, ordinarily made. \n\nThe sex was real. That much was certain. The perks of this job were beneath the sheets, however cheap the bedding. The comfort of an escort in Montreal is relative to the price they pay. You paid as much for me as you might for your first car. More often than not, I was the first escort that my clients were like to hire. Husbands of destitute marriages travelling to the freer city across the river, across the border, to experience someone they thought they once had, chasing the ghost of a made-up past full of love and excitement. After the first bite, they quickly moved to prostitutes, disillusioned and horny. \n\nYou can usually tell what kind of a marriage a man is in by the tone of his email. The first email always reads the same way--polite, yet masked in sexual appetite and and come-forward attitude best left reserved for La Bombe at last call. It was not a place you wanted to be, but a place you find yourself without knowing why. \n\nThe second email was what defined them. What they wanted, when they wanted it, how much they could pay for it. Nothing flattering, nothing superficial, just straight brass tax. Their whole married life was told in that second email, whether the marriage was failing due to money, sex, or simple lack of passion. Usually it was sex.\n\nMr. Chicago was different. His first email read like a loan agreement, full of everything but emotion. All the details of his request were laid out like a whore lined up at the gates, and all without even the presumption of intimacy. Here was a man who had bought a car before, and on his own money no doubt. Yet if it was sex or lack of passion the mister lacked, he made no show of it. \n\n*Double your regular pay to pretend to be my banking colleague.*\n\nThat much to sit across a table and talk assets and dividends. I was hooked, and found myself filling in the sultry aspects of our conversation that Mr. Chicago had left out. \n\n*I\'d prefer you in a suit. I\'ll see you soon. Look official.*\n\nI pulled the coverlet up to the nape of my neck. *I felt more naked in that suit than I do now.* It was so well made, it might as well have been bet on. It was likely I would never wear it again--though seeing as all costs were included in Mr. Chicago\'s outline, I was likely not to care. The modest light-charcoal skirt was not something most husbands cared to see on a business trip. \n\nI met Mr. Chicago outside of business hours in the seemingly classy restaurant of La Silhouette. The sky was grey and greyer, though inside the restaurant the light was a warm tease of gold and orange. Champagne chair and champagne tablecloths were laid out in the room, and champagne buckets and champagne bottles adorned them. Ours was rosy, almost purple in colour, and the top was a twist-off that the waiter obliged to open. \n\nMr. Chicago was late, though he walked in to the room as if he was always on time. I watched him adjust his suite coat and tie in the foyer and then flick a strand of hair behind his ears. *He isn\'t half ugly* I thought. After a few words with the matron, he spun toward the open archway of the room and cantered in decidedly. He gazed about in search of his actor, more highly paid than most. \n\nHe couldn\'t remember where he had told me to sit, that much was clear. As he made his way through the tables, he bumped several of the other patrons. One table, a man and a women in obvious dissatisfaction, was clearly annoyed at the intrusion, though they seemed to be clearly annoyed at most everything. The single man seated at the table closest to us simply ignored Mr. Chicago and continued to sip on water, the champagne bottle unopened on the table in front of him. \n\nI put on a face of pleasure and greeted my jockey for the night. He was peppered in the beard, but well trimmed. His hair was well-greased, and his musk hinted of sweat and clothes and tobacco. His eyes were deep and dark, and mesmerizing. *These are the eyes of a man out to seduce me.* I put on a face much the same in return, and winked coyly as I smirked and introduced myself.\n\n""Mr. Chicago, it was so wonderful for you to treat me to dinner this evening. You must be exhausted from travel.""\n\nHe suddenly looked confused. *Did I say something wrong?* He had given me a list of details and items to talk about, and his travel arrangements had been chief among them. ""Yes, my travels. They were quite exhausting. And I\'m sure yours were just as tiresome. Did you come by train?""', 'The table is set, the candles are lit, and this is going to be the greatest use of $400 ever. \n\nThe male is waiting, suit far too tight for his upper body stretching in anticipation. He has this look in his eyes as if to say, ""At least I don\'t have to shit on anyone,"" and I, too, have that look. But burrowed in that look; deep inside its gooey guts like a caramel chocolate is joy - Oh wonderous joy. \n\nThe woman arrives, femme fatale in appearance and struts over to the man. The way she moves, Christ, a succubus in hell hasn\'t got a chance to be hotter than that. She sits, a smirk splintering across her face like venom, and speaks.\n\n""Hello Lance,"" Even mountains would melt in the aura of her voice, dripping out of her in such a sultry manner I found myself falling in love with two words. ""I\'m glad we have a moment to relax, these last few weeks have been... *stressful*"" \n\n""One way to say that, Susan,"" he replies, becoming the physical embodiment of masculinity. He lazily brushes his fingers through his thick brown beard, before leaning forward. ""I\'ve been so pent up trying to get the office sorted. I need a way to blow off some steam.""\n\n""I\'ve been bent over the cabinets for weeks trying to sort everything,"" her lips smack when she finishes the last syllable, and the left side of her smile rises. Small, subtle, and charming. \n\n""It\'s the way I like you,"" he states. The power and commandment in his voice make me completely aware as to why women like to call their partners \'Daddy\'. I want to call him Daddy. \n\n""Do you want any more breadsticks, sir?""\n\nI turn, a waitress. I bite, ""No, I am fine, I am wonderful, please leave me alone, I have important business to attend to."" I turn back; they\'re walking out the door. \n\nOh no.  The prostitutes are off to have sex already. Why can\'t they just keep it in their pants, I need this, fuck. I stand and wipe some breadsticks dust off my lap, and sigh. Oh well, I got what I needed. \n\nI walk out the door, a buffet of surprise knocking the wind out of me, as two familiar faces staring at me.\n\n""Hey Lachlan,""  Lance says, not prostitute Lance, real Lance. ""We didn\'t see you at the meeting. Management said you had somewhere to be,"" \n\n""Yeah, yeah,"" I calmly speak, ""Lunch with some clients."" I look at the two of them. ""So, what are you two lovebirds up to?"" I say, my eyes smiling.\n\n""We\'re getting lunch,"" Susan replies. ""And can you stop trying to push that office romance? We\'re work colleagues, just that."" \n\n""Of course,"" I say. ""Apologies. I\'ll see you later Lance."" I walk past him, patting his back as I do, and laugh to myself quietly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out /r/Rhysyjay for other neat stuff. \n\n\n', 'I sat, listening as these... *sex workers*... tried to have a conversation like *normal* human beings, giggling to myself and my ingenuity.\n\n""This is a little dehumanizing, isn\'t it?"" Craig asked, arms folded. He always provided such droll perspectives on our little excursions.\n\n""Oh, it\'s more than a little,"" I said. ""Look at them, they think they\'re people.""\n\n""They are people.""\n\n""You know what I mean. Middle class people. With respectable jobs. Careers. Lives. Security. Maybe families. Reasons to live. It\'s ever so delightful to listen to their mimicry.""\n\n""You really are an asshole."" Craig wasn\'t wrong. ""Why do you do this kind of thing?""\n\n""I\'m a rich sociopath who treats my social inferiors like playthings for my amusement."" I was honest. Deception was for people who had to strive for things, who knew struggle. I knew only idle disdain. To be quite honest, I felt as distant and removed from Craig as I did the prostitutes I\'d hired. There was no point of common connection. Not to him. Not even to the other idle rich. \n\nCraig looked disgusted. Good. The more of these little \'experiments\' I exposed him to, the more I would understand the human condition. I wondered if I could get him to kill someone. I wondered what it would be like to strangle my only friend in the world with my bare hands.\n\nThen the soup arrived, and I turned my attention back to my playthings. I wonder... if I\'d been born in less exalted circumstances, would I have developed some sense of morality? I like to think so.

Prada light turquoise pointy toe pump; devil wears Prada, what else would you expect? An expensive prostitute is still a prostitute. A Louis Vuitton Croc matte, nothing fancy there. Dior qiviut grey blue A-line with blazer freshly delivered from Paris, Chanel pearl earrings laced with gold, Cornelia James pashmina straight out of Kashmir; get this, she paid an insurer to actually go to Kashmir, witness it being made there before airmailed express to London, packaged and sent to New York with the personal thank you note from Genevieve James.

But no one seemed to understand the price one has to pay. Justice? No, I don‚Äôt care for justice. I am not a facilitator. I only care if my steak is well done and only now is it getting started, just passing bloody. Rest assured, I am banging Miss Griffin and Mr. Clarkson in a threesome tonight, to give them hope, the simmers before I leave them to their own devices. Leverage.

It is I who buy them new expensive clothes for every week and I pay for the first class meal as well. It had now gone about two months of the same procedure, every week at the same restaurant at the same time and with the same people. I never got what their names were, but it doesn't matter anyway. It's just so funny listening to those two rags trying to be professional. It is like watching a one-legged man dance and thinks that he dances like Rudolf Nureyev. And the best of it is that I am in control and can change the scenario however I want. \n\nThey are now sitting at the table in front of me, talking their usual bullshit. This is probably their highlight of the week. To just for one night per week escape their fucked up reality and be someone else. It is my highlight of the week as well.\n\nThere they are. In their fancy clothes, in a fancy restaurant, believing that they are making the earth a better place. They think that without this meeting the stocks will crash or that without them the bank would be ruined. They live with the illusion that they are important.

As i ordered dinner i started the conversation ""So, Angel, did you finish the Trimester report?"" Angel stuttered before answering ""I-I\'m still working on them, but they should be due this week"" she looked towards Jay and with a more incredulous tone she asked ""And what about you, Jay? What do YOU work at?"" Jay looked at me confused before answering ""I work at the bank too, perhaps i have not seen you because I\'m always so busy working in the credit cards department, but you must work at the front handing money, right?""

We all knew we were killers, and knowing who all the other killers were helped people get along. Sold a secret? Everyone would hunt you down the next day. \n\nEveryone had their flair out, so you could have as much fun as you wanted while still fitting in. The Japanese would dress all in earth tones, while the Italians would put on fantastically gauche suits. The British, as always, sent their best in a tuxedo. I wore my best denim. \n\nNobody ever expected a Canadian assassin. We were there in WWII, killing Hitler in his bunker before the other Allies even arrived. They had to burn the body and claim suicide to cover up their incompetence. We were there when Osama bin Laden was found. I\'ll bet the Navy Seals won\'t tell you they found him chained to his desk with a complimentary last meal of poutine. \n\nDon\'t think we\'re friendly. We don\'t take anybody\'s side but Canada\'s. We were there when JFK was shot. It was so simple to play one superpower against another and score lucrative deals for the Canadarm project. It\'s nice to know we can smuggle a high-powered laser into space, even if it\'s only one shot. \n\nStill, an assassin is only as good as his cover. We instill our children from an early age just how to act in public while we train them in private how to apply political pressure points as well as physical ones. We\'re the kindest, nicest people around when somebody is watching. \n\nWe train to be normal and accepting, while pushing the idea that a sneaky killer has to know kung fu and how to throw daggers. The Japanese popular culture has already been successfully subverted, and we\'re working with a mole at Ubisoft to produce more Assassin\'s Creed games to subvert Arab, British, Italian and now Egyptian cultures. They would never suspect us. \n\nWe could even get away with an assassination here at the convention, just for fun. I bump into another excited conventioneer dressed head-to-toe, embarassingly, in his mother\'s best black sheets. I pull the punch knife from his kidney slowly while the invisible needle in his neck stops him from screaming. \n\n""Sorry.""\n\nEDIT: Got the Assassin\'s Creed publisher wrong. Changed ""EA"" to ""Ubisoft.""\nEDIT: Thank you, kind stranger!', 'My codename is Green Man because technically I\'m a recycler. I repurpose the old, shine it up nice and sleek so that it may be made new. Most people don\'t know this, but the modernization of Japan has never quite stopped. There are pockets of holdouts where tradition clings on. Like the samurai of old, it\'s my job to repurpose their stubbornness before they are gunned down by Gatling guns. \n\nOr, you know, in this case, DNA seeking armor piercing sniper bullets discharged from an auto-drone flying miles in the air.\n\nBut try explaining that to guys who toss ninja stars at dart boards.\n \nMost of my students are under the impression our roles are reversed.\n\n‚ÄúSami-son,‚Äù they call me. ‚ÄúDo you see how the wind blows?‚Äù\n\nThey smile, the edges of their masks crinkling up like dimples. \n\nI pinch the bridge of my nose and sigh. \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre standing under a vent,‚Äù I try to explain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called air conditioning.‚Äù\n\nOther times, I sit the ninjas down and pop them popcorn. I‚Äôve blocked out time for a James Bond marathon, so they may see how a real spy operates in the treacherous political climate of the modern day. Plus, I mean, hey, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with entertainment. \n\nExcept one class clown tosses popcorn at another. Before I know it, they\'re missing the damned point. They\'re hiding in the shadows, kernels flying from behind curtains.

The big guys upstairs boast at every holiday party. Once again, the West helps out the little brother in the East. But truth is, they‚Äôve never stepped foot inside the academy. They just smile and clap my back, saying, ‚Äúkeep up the good work.‚Äù\n\nOr, even worse, they pull me aside and pitch their next brilliant idea. We‚Äôre talking idiocy ranging from amphibious ninja-manned submarines to planting ninjas in the secret service. \n\nLike, just yesterday, a stiff in a suit pulled me aside and said one word. His teeth were grayed from way too much coffee. \n\n‚ÄúHackers,‚Äù he whispered, raising his bushy brows. \n\nSo, the ever-obedient Green Man must now sit ninjas down in front of a computer. \n\nMy first pupil powers the thing on and attacks it like a pecking chicken.

Now we go find.‚Äù\n\nThe masked man nods so fast, the knots nearly come loose. He squints at the screen and begins pecking away. Letters miraculously form in the search bar. The ninja‚Äôs fingers become a blur. For a moment, I think we may be on to something. \n\nLike, maybe my career is worthwhile after all. I look over to Brenda and give her a thumbs up.\n\nAnd when I turn back, my example sheet is missing. The ninja winks at me, and my stomach just drops. \n\nHe‚Äôs got the sheet folded between his fingers.\n\n‚ÄúAlways be watching, Sami-son,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúLet not even the call of a grasshopper sway the focus of your mind.‚Äù\n\nFrom her desk, Brenda snorts out a laugh.

""I\'m sorry I had to be the one to tell you, eh.""', 'Asla had never travelled this far east before. She chose to hike the last stretch of her journey, leaving her beat-up car under a tarpaulin, tucked behind a copse of trees. Nature had beat back man‚Äôs progress here, and all she had for company were the skittish wildlife, the rush of the waterfalls, the snowflakes cascading down belligerently. Walking rejuvenated her, but more importantly, it gave her a chance to attune her senses, probe for the Folkvarthr, the guardian of the town.\n\nShe found him perched on a rocky outcrop, just a couple of miles from Seydisfjordur. Asla knew she made no noise, left barely an imprint on the fresh snow beneath her feet, but before such an experienced master, she might as well have been beating a drum, strumming a lyre.\n\n‚ÄúFolkvarthr, I come in peace,‚Äù she said, keeping her distance. She used the honorific so that he would know that she was cut from the same cloth, another member of the ancient clan sworn to protect their country. Underneath her shawl, she gripped her twin knives, priming her defences. It never hurt to be prudent.\n\nThe older man turned then, and for a moment Asla wondered if the reports were embellished. There was a placid calmness to him, and none of the fire and brimstone she was cautioned about. His eyes, dulled with age, reminded her of the frozen orbs she sometimes had to scrape out of bowls she had left out.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall asking to be relieved,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am not yet battle-weary. I intend to guard this town until I die.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOlafur, you have done us a great service,‚Äù Asla replied. ‚ÄúThe records run with the great deeds you have accomplished. You have saved this town more times than anyone can count. You have more than earned your rest.‚Äù\n\nOlafur scrounged on the ground, picked up a couple of smoothened pebbles. Asla narrowed her eyes, but this time she was over-suspicious ‚Äì Olafur aimed the small missiles not at her, but at three spots away from them, one to the north and the others to the west. There was but a bleak light still illuminating the valley, so Asla relied instead on her hearing to determine where the pebbles landed.\n\n‚ÄúThose are where the rifts are,‚Äù said Olafur, dusting his palms off. ‚ÄúThe monsters don‚Äôt come as often now, but they still can, and they still do. They are different from the ones you deal with back in Reykjavik, or wherever the hell you came from. Nature emboldens them. They don‚Äôt emerge at night, skulking in the shadows. No, these prefer the day, where they revel in being seen, being feared. There‚Äôs a sadism in these parts that only I can handle, young one.‚Äù\n\nThere‚Äôs a sadism alright, thought Asla, but instead she said, ‚ÄúI will be straightforward, Folkvarthr. This is not a request. The Council has asked that you retire, with immediate effect.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh? After all the good work I‚Äôve done?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúToo good, in fact,‚Äù said Asla. ‚ÄúReports have come in that you no longer communicate with the town, that you have completely shut yourself off from them. The local children don‚Äôt even dare come near you anymore, and they have started calling you the Boogeyman, the Reaper. Even worse, the monsters that you slay‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not just putting them down, you‚Äôre *slaughtering* them. The Council has reason to believe that you-‚Äù\n\nOlafur chose to move at that moment, streaking in a blur towards highground. Asla was ready, and so she followed closely behind, matching him step for step. She considered the possibility that he was leading her towards a trap, but pushed that thought away. She had to believe that there was humanity yet left in him.\n\nSome hundred feet above the ground, a cave opened up alongside the hill, hidden if one were only looking in from the roads. Olafur paused there, then snapped his fingers, bringing to life the candles within. Asla discerned immediately the two urns on one side of the cave, and the heaps of ash on the other.\n\n‚ÄúThey took my family, was that in your reports too?‚Äù Olafur asked. ‚ÄúI had just saved the town from another invasion, took down no less than three ghouls and two ogres on my own. They come in waves, so I thought we were safe for a while. But they were hiding, down by the waters when my daughter went to swim. My Hansa struggled with them, but she is no practitioner of glima that I am.‚Äù\n\nIn that moment, Asla understood why the Council had chosen her, of all the practitioners, and a tiny bit of the tension in her seeped away. She was not going to die here today, after all. ‚ÄúNo words can convey my condolences,‚Äù she said, eventually.\n\nOlafur didn‚Äôt seem to hear. ‚ÄúAnd everyday, everyday I add on to the ashes of my enemies. I think, maybe, when there‚Äôs enough of it, it will all make sense again, feel right again.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHas it worked?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Olafur, ‚Äúnot yet. And that is why I cannot stop, you see? I have to keep going. I have to keep-‚Äù\n\nAsla lashed out, her knives glinting as they sung through the air. She was not given to surprise attacks, but this was an opponent far more skilled than she was, and she would have to take what the gods of chance gave her. Heck, she had only felled the one ogre in her life, and that was quite an anemic one at that. \n\nOlafur caught her blows easily, striking at her wrists, deflecting her attacks. He stepped in, pushed his shoulder against her midriff, then lifted her legs. Asla tensed and recoiled, twisting in the air, landing on her feet. If she fell, it was over.\n\nRound and round they went, like marbles in a cone, striking and rebounding, feinting and parrying. At times it seemed that Asla, with her youth and vigor and aggression, had the edge. But Olafur would come back, a crashing fjord of implacable power, brushing her off like a weevil. Then, a slip, as Asla‚Äôs foot caught on an uneven patch of ground, throwing her off just a couple of inches.\n\nOlafur seized the moment, overwhelming her with a deathgrip. Asla kept still, quivering despite her best efforts. She was at his mercy.\n\n‚ÄúWhy does the Council stop me?‚Äù he asked, breathing heavily. ‚ÄúCan a man not have his revenge?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou are showing signs of taint, Olafur! Do you not see that? In a year, or two, will your bloodlust have calmed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am *in control*!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhy do you think I have not snapped your neck?‚Äù\n\nAsla sighed, then relinquished her knives, dropping them to the ground. Olafur had not yet yielded in the face of her surrender, so there was only one course of action left. \n\n‚ÄúI bring with me too another message from the Council,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúStraight from your master‚Äôs mouth, the same one who assigned you here years ago. He bids me to remind you that you have done your part, that you deserve, at the least, some rest. ‚ÄòAny of us can quell the monsters, Olafur, but only you can tend to your wounds. Let Asla carry on your work for you.‚Äô That is what he said.‚Äù\n\nAsla waited, and eventually Olafur loosened his hold. She broke free, then turned to assess her opponent. The fight had deserted him, and the hunch in his back, the despair on his brows ‚Äì there was no more duelling to be had. Olafur averted his gaze, but Asla caught the hint of moistness in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶ she would be around your age, if she were still alive, you know?‚Äù Olafur said, staring off into the distance.\n\nYou bastards, she thought. It‚Äôs not fair sending someone who reminds him of his daughter to fight him. That‚Äôs just underhanded.\n\n‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said.\n\nThere they sat, as the sun completed its retreat, and the stars reclaimed their fair share of the heavens. From the distance they heard the merriment from the town ‚Äì preparations were underway for the winter festivals, and Asla sensed that even the monsters would have the decency to stay away this night.\n\n‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs good for dinner?‚Äù she asked, tentatively.\n\nOlafur sighed. ‚ÄúI can show you, if you like.‚Äù\n\nAsla smiled.\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny \n', 'The problem with Japan‚Äôs was that they tried to mass produce them. Sure, they got thousands of ninjas, but those guys belonged more in a circus than the battlefield. They could climb walls decently fast? Move around a little silent? Give me a break.

Real ninjas are not so cheap and I promise you, you‚Äôve never heard of a single one.\n\n---\n\nAgent Sarah Romanov had her hands cuffed behind her, her supervisor with his gun twitching on the trigger, pointed directly at her head. And she had thought they had a decent work relationship.\n\n‚ÄúI assure you, Agent Romanov,‚Äù her boss, Agent Kingsley, said. ‚ÄúThis is to protect you.‚Äù\n\nSarah flicked her eyes over to the pitch-black end of his pistol. Somewhere along the six levels of security clearance they went through just to arrive in this interrogation room, her boss had lost his mind. No bodyguard had ever pulled their pistol on their mark claiming to protect them.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm handcuffed, Jeff.‚Äù It was simple and probably didn‚Äôt work on a trained CIA operative, but saying people‚Äôs first names minimalized their odds of killing you. ‚ÄúDo you really need to point a gun at me?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis is standard protocol for this meeting.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIs this because of my last name?‚Äù Sarah had spent six years as a field agent with no prospects of promotion. She had a good idea why. Performance issues were a good bet, but then she became the best around and nothing changed. Then came the woman angle, but the CIA didn‚Äôt really cared for the particular spy, only the intel. At last, she came to the conclusion of her nationality. She was Russian.\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù her boss said, but a slight inflection at the start of the word gave him away.\n\nThe door opened and a man in a graphic tank top walked in. He had pink sunglasses and blonde hair with frosted tips. If Sarah had to guess, a frat boy had wandered drunkenly into the wrong building and somehow past the maximum level of US security clearance to arrive here still looking for a spot to piss in. But as soon as he walked in, her boss‚Äôs finger tensed on the trigger.\n\n‚ÄúAgent Romanov,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeet codename Derek. He is a secret more well-guarded than what goes on in Area 51. If you ever wonder why the United States is the military might of the world, you‚Äôre looking at the reason.‚Äù\n\nSarah stared. Medium build. Average height. Healthy weight. There was nothing at all spectacular about this *Codename Derek*.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as jumpy as ever, Jeff,‚Äù Derek said and pulled out the seat across from them. He sat down and plopped his feet on the table between them. ‚ÄúSarah Romanov, you‚Äôre hotter in person.‚Äù\n\nThe frown on Sarah‚Äôs lips deepened. Surely, this was a prank. But her boss‚Äôs cheeks hadn‚Äôt had any color in them for the past hour now.\n\nDerek leaned forward and wagged a finger in front of him. ‚ÄúYou wanna know why I chose you as my Operator? I like the way you look,‚Äù he said, chuckling. ‚ÄúSo, don‚Äôt let it get to your head. Higher ups begged me to pick someone else, to even give their reports and recommendation a glance. But I found you on Facebook and pointed at you and said that‚Äôs the one. And here you are.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm here to babysit you?‚Äù Sarah asked. She had only a single experience as an operator and it wasn‚Äôt a good one. Her asset had died, quite violently.\n\n‚ÄúMore or less.‚Äù He got up, grinning. Steel grinded against steel as his chair scraped the ground. ‚ÄúHeard the last one you babysat died. I won‚Äôt be dying. Though there‚Äôll be many more opportunities to do so.‚Äù And he snapped his finger.\n\nJeff Kingsley yelped and his gun clattered onto the ground. He clutched his chest, groaning. It was a heart attack! Sarah got up out her chair to help, but her hands were still cuffed behind her.\n\n‚ÄúC‚Äômon,‚Äù Jeff said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my operator. You were supposed to stop me from doing stupid shit like that. To be fair, I injected the kill pill long before you so this one‚Äôs not entirely your fault.‚Äù\n\nSarah looked around, waiting for the paramedics to come bursting through one of the two doors in the interrogation room. Nobody came. Instead, Jeff just rolled across the ground, his face purple as he began choking.\n\nShe pressed her lips together and knelt down beside him. She slammed her head into his chest and began compressions. It wasn‚Äôt working.\n\n‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Derek said, dropping a blue pill onto the ground. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the antidote. Have him swallow that and he‚Äôll be fine in seconds. Only problem is that I only have one and truthfully, this was going to be your antidote.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMine?‚Äù\n\nHe shrugged. ‚ÄúDid I stutter?‚Äù\n\nWithout a second thought, Sarah took the pill between her teeth and fed it to her boss. ‚ÄúSwallow,‚Äù she told him.\n\nHer boss followed her instruction and immediately the deep purple faded from his face. He stopped rolling around. At last, even his breath returned with a giant gasp. Sarah whipped around toward Derek, glaring at the man, but he only returned her a small smile.\n\n‚ÄúI suppose I was right to choose you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd they told me that I should try thinking for once.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù she growled.\n\n‚ÄúAn old man with a few parlor tricks up my sleeve.

Set in glade alone, ringed by silent pines, the the wooden hut looked ancient, and it was.\n\nFirst built by the United Ninja Clans nearly four-hundred years ago, it was meant to be a place of quiet reflection and shared experience. A place where the clans of the world would gather once a decade and celebrate their skill and discuss the world-at-large. Now, in these dark times, the meetings that the hut hosted had taken on a new meaning.\n\nThe heavy wooden door groaned deafeningly as Kentaro-san swung it only wide enough for his thin, sinewy frame to slip through. The interior of the hut was silent and as cold as outside beneath the stars. In the center of the hut sat the great round table that so many of his ancestors and peers had sat at through the decades. A nightbird outside called out to no-one. He was early.\n\nAs the senior member of Clan Nihon, as well as its most learned, he was elected by his peers to attend this most grave of meetings. A representative from all of the clans would be in attendance: the Shogun-Cowboys of the Americas, the copper-and-cotton Hashassins of the Arabic nations, the brightly-patterned but silent Warrior-Priests of Africa, and the long-hidden tribesmen from the Amazons. Even the Voices of Valhalla from the cold north, who rarely came down from their blissful mountain sanctuaries, would be in attendance. Indeed, the threat from The Orange One was too great to ignore further.\n\nTo keep his early arrival to himself, Kentaro-san slipped into the shadows on his padded footwear. Wedging himself between a thick wooden stud and an eons-old chair, he prepared himself to meditate silently while awaiting the arrival of his fellow ninjas.\n\nJust as he closed his eyes for prayer, he heard the deep, booming Voice of Valhalla call out from seemingly nowhere, and everywhere:\n\n""Glad you could join us, Kentaro-san.

The International Ninja Cup was a mere day away, and as his feet padded softly on the back and forth on the floor his mind was furiously at work.

But, he bore a heavy weight - it was his responsibility to attempt to redeem Japan after years of shame.\n\nHundreds of years of competition, and each and every result the same - Japan disgracing itself with a last place finish. No matter the advancements in technology, no matter the focus on personal discipline, Japan could not seem to produce ninjas with the skill and talent of other nations. \n\nA soft sigh escaped Shinji\'s lips as he shook his head for the hundredth time - he must not let his focus slip for even an instant. He must keep his mind sharp, lest one small error lead to his team\'s downfall. He stepped to the window to take in the beautiful morning view, a small smile crossing his face; yes, as long as he could maintain precise concentration, he would lead Japan out of last place for the first time in recorded history. He was sure of it. \n\nHe turned away to recheck his equipment one more time when a sizzling blur scythed the air beside his head. A shuriken embedded itself with a thud into the wall two inches beside his head, shattering his concentration and sending adrenaline coursing through his veins.\n\nHe leapt to the window, pulling a dagger from his belt, ready to defend himself from this obvious attempt to sabotage his team. However, as his eyes scanned the rooftops and skyline surrounding his hotel room, he could not see any trace of his attacker. He easily spotted Toshi, who was on guard duty. Using ninja hand signals he asked the master ninja if he had seen the failed assassin, but Toshi indicated that he hadn\'t even noticed the attack. \n\nEnraged, Shinji flew to the wall where the weapon had lodged itself. Prying it loose he noted the 9-pointed maple leaf of its shape, identifying itself undeniably as the work of the Canada Clan. But, for the first time he also noticed the attached note. Retrieving it, he read the words slowly to himself, cheeks reddening as he did.\n\n""Hello Shinji. Hope all is well. Sorry to bother you, but we are trying to get ready for the big competition tomorrow, and we were wondering if you wouldn\'t mind keeping down the noise? Between you stomping around your room and blustering loudly to yourself, we\'re finding it real hard to get anything done.

That's what everyone out in the sunlight believes, and we make sure it remains that way to this day.\n\nNinja have been evolving in the 21st century. They're becoming skilled in more than just the arts of stealth and combat. Cyber warfare is huge, and we have all of the data.\n\nRussian, American, British, Mexican, even the North Korean data comes to us, and if we see it fit it gets sent out under the mention of an anonymous tip, or filtered through some politicians.\n\nJapan is the problem child in our great big family. The ninja there have yet to gather ANY useful information from the Japanese government. This is mostly due to them refusing to wear plainclothes and instead dressing in the stereotypical ninja wear that you'd see in movies. Black mask, black clothes, sword on hip, etc.\n\nThe Russian division is insisting we move in soon to take over, because currently Japan is our wildcard. \n\nWe move at daybreak."", 'It\'s 7 PM, and I\'m set up in the lobby of the Albany Marriott. My target is due downstairs in about 10 minutes, so I have plenty of time to check over my equipment.\n\nPoison needles... check. Ceramic dagger... check. Ballpoint pen... check.\n\n...oh shit... is that **Fukunaga?**\n\nFuck. It is.\n\nI catch him staring at me from a bush outside. He\'s dressed in that idiotic ninja garb that screams ""**HEY, OVER HERE!!! I\'M A NINJA!!! DON\'T TELL ANYONE YOU CAN SEE ME!!!**""\n\nNow, I have much respect for the traditions of the *kage*. They were once the great warriors of the shadows, and could infiltrate a castle, kill a man, and leave before anyone was aware they were a target... and best of all, no one would suspect it was an assassination.\n\nThen they got cocky.\n\nThey let word of their deeds out, purportedly to ""spread fear among their potential victims."" They also let themselves stagnate under the weight of tradition.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the rest of the practitioners adapted, learned to blend in the modern world, ditched those fucking pajamas and got better than the originals.\n\nSo now my mission may be blown because of some short-bus killer who stands out when he should be...\n\nOh... idea time.\n\nFive minutes to go, and I gesture to a coworker. ""Hey... who is that in the bush outside?""\n\n""Dude, whatcha been smokin\'? Can you, like... oh shit, dude, yer right! There\'s, like, a guy in that bush!""\n\nHe points right at Fukunaga. He\'s speaking so loud that the 4 or 5 guests in the lobby look where he\'s pointing.\n\nI see Fukunaga startle, then duck his head down into his hood. Probably to bite the cyanide capsule he has sewn into the lining.\n\nJoke\'s on him. I swapped it for a Nyquil caplet 2 or 3 years ago in Rome, when he tried to cut in on another job. Fucked that up, too, as he got spotted by a **priest**, if you can believe it, who called the Swiss Guard to report a possible attempt on the Pope\'s life.\n\n(He was kind of close... I was after a cardinal. Took an extra two days with the heightened security.)\n\nFukunaga falls dramatically to the ground to prepare for his ""death throes,"" and I see my target leave the elevator flanked by two rent-a-thugs.\n\nI pull the ink part out of my Bic pen, slide the needle into the barrel, and puff hard into the end, I see a brief glint of light on surgical steel, and the point pokes into the target\'s neck.\n\nAt the same moment as the victim slaps the needle deeper into his flesh (guaranteeing a painful death 4 hours from now... that\'s what you get when you rape a congressman\'s son, you sick Mafia fuck), the gorillas spot Fukunaga failing to spasm in death, and start towards the dumb bastard.\n\nI turn to the coworker. ""Hey, can you take the desk for a second? I have to take a piss.""\n\n""Yeah, man... don\'t you want to see the excitement, though?""\n\nNo, not really. I want to get as far away from here as I can before that greasy pedo drops dead.\n\n""No... I\'v **really** got to go.""\n\nAs I leave the desk (never to return... sorry, dude), I see Fukunaga jump to his feet and run like his life depends on it (which it does, given the size of the bodyguards chasing him) and chuckle quietly.\n\nSometimes, tradition **does** come in handy.', ""What do you see when I say the word 'ninja'? Clad in black, hooded, some kunais and knives hanging from their belt? Well, that just shows you how bad they really were at hiding. Sure they're trying to reinvent their image but their so steeped in history that the elders find it appalling to change tradition.\n\nBut they're not the only ninjas that exist. There's more, all around the world. They hide in plain sight.\n\nYou want an example? Well, find the most hipster looking guy or girl around you. See one? Alright, follow them. They're heading to the Chatime stand, right? Well, I know for a fact what they're gonna order. Caramel Milk Tea, extra bubble jelly and five shots of sugar. Absolutely diabetic, but that's the secret code they give to get their mission. Even the employees don't know about it, they just mindlessly key in the order and swipe their rewards card, which is more identification. They get that little slip of paper, and from there they get their mission before rubbing the ink off with their finger.\n\nThat's how we get our missions.\n\nWeapons? Well, it is illegal to openly carry here in Malaysia, but phones are getting pretty smart these days, and theirs are no exception. They mainly get by without attacking anyone, using the phone with top of the line decryption algorithms to get through the toughest security there is. But when push comes to shove they've got a trick or two up their sleeves. Their glasses have sharpened ear rests. Their phones can fire a tranquilizer dart from the charging port. Used to be the headphone jack but Apple caught on to us. Had to change it. That's about it really. Our ninjas specialize in information. Which is why you don't see many unexplainable deaths happening here.\n\nOnly one you may have heard of is the Altantuya case, but we needed him to take the top spot. We thought he'd be easily manipulated. Then he started getting greedy, so we started leaking stuff online.\n\nBecause we deal in information.\n\nWhich is why I'm talking to you openly about this. Because you're not supposed to be here much longer. Nice meeting you by the way. You're a great listener.\n\n----------------------\n\nDone at a restaurant on mobile, so forgive the writing. Feedback always welcome! Just wanted to sort of build the world I suppose. "", '> \tAgent Jormundson walked down hallway leading into the briefing room awaiting what he thought would be a very boring briefing on the Japanese military. Agent Thor ""Hammer"" Jormundson was an old hand at these meetings. Last week it was the Korean Army vs. the North Koreans, and today it was the South Korean allies, the JSDF. He‚Äôd heard it all before, even though it was classified, it never meant it was interesting. The CIA had a thing about having a plan for a plan for a plan, and of course never using any of them. This was something that he sort of liked. Jormundson loved his on-the-spot planning, he felt the agency really came alive when he had to think on his feet.\n> \n> \tNot that he was going to do that for the next hour, instead he mentally prepared himself to read more graphs than anyone could remember, and pretend to write notes on goings on in the far east that he couldn‚Äôt possibly be less interested in. The Japanese were a stubborn and conservative people, very meticulous; but for someone who‚Äôs expertise was in Europe alone: absolutely boring. He walked into the room with a look of absolute boredom that he knew that the adviser was bound to expect. However the room was empty.\n> \n> \tJormundsen turned around and looked at the room number, and found he was in the right room, but it was empty, save for the conference table, a large TV, and office chairs that probably cost more than he made in three months. As his eyes came down from the room sign, he saw an older man walking down the hallway flanked with two other men in very unusual uniform, he‚Äôd seen many, but these struck him, he‚Äôd never quite seen anything like it.\n> \n> \tJormundsen who‚Äôd just sat down brushed himself off as he sat up and reached out for a handshake. ‚Äúpleasure, I‚Äôm Jormundsen, you must be Jeremy Winton?‚Äù \n> \n> \tJormundsen was thoroughly thrown off at this point, the two men wore what seemed to be a military uniform, but had what looked like balaclava‚Äôs up to their eyes, and small slits like gills alongside their necks, in these slits was some more cloth covered in red, white and blue stripes. On their shoulders were the usual camo United States Flag patches. They were in Military fatigues and seemed eerily quiet, almost as if while walking they were called to attention and floated down the hallway. They entered the room, like ghosts.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúPleasure Agent, sit, we have something a little different planned for today. I want you to understand that anything said here goes under the standard guidelines. This Is all Top Secret with repercussions that go beyond your time here in the CIA.‚Äù The old Asian man ignored his handshake and sat down closing the door as he entered the room.\n> \n> \tThe two men at his sides taking other chairs across the table. The first who had brown eyes pulled the power plug of the TV, and sat down. The Blue eyes of the other, burned into the side of Jormundson‚Äôs head as he sat down, and continued his stare. Brown eyes seemed tired, and crossed his arms and closed his eyes. He seemed to be listening very intently, he then sat down murmuring ‚ÄúDamn NSA‚Äù.\n> \n> \tJeremy crossed his hands on the table, speaking with reserve and a steady voice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve brought you here today to brief you on a job opportunity, that if accepted will put you in a very small group of interesting individuals.‚Äù He gazed at Jormundson who by now seemed thoroughly confused.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember signing up for a new position, I do however remember that I have a report due on the Japanese Self Defense Force that won‚Äôt write itself.‚Äù Jormundson had regained his composure and was now getting annoyed at being led through this strangeness. He wanted to get through with it and get writing, so he could get home early for a change.\n> \n> \tJeremy continued, uninterested with his irate tablemate‚Äôs report, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lot like your father, before we poached him from The Swedish Lightning.‚Äù He smiled at the puzzled look that immediately flashed across his face.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúMy father was a postmaster in Duluth, Minnesota until his dying day. So I wouldn‚Äôt presume you knew my father.‚Äù Jormundson rebutted, offended at the pretense.\n> \n> \tThe old man gave out a small laugh and smiled. ‚ÄúOh I knew old Jormund well, he was the best in class in Sweden, but Sweden doesn‚Äôt know war, so Sweden loses it‚Äôs best chess pieces.‚Äù He put his hand flat on the table towards Jormundson who looked like he was about to get up and walk out. ‚ÄúDid you ever wonder why a postmaster from Duluth would travel to Europe for government business? Did you ever wonder how a postmaster could afford to send his three sons to the most prestigious colleges? And then mysteriously disappear into Huron after a car crash on the Mackinac Bridge?‚Äù\n> \n> \tThis was growing very unsettling for Jormundson who had just began to remember the solemn and quick and quiet funeral that the government had paid for. It was strange, though he said his teary goodbyes, it all felt so fast, almost as if there was no time or money for grieving. He had since grown to accept it since it was nearly twenty years ago now. It revived that wonder he had about why the Postmen always seemed nervous when he asked them what his father‚Äôs job was like at the office, since he was never allowed to go.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúSon, I‚Äôm about to tell you something that about a hundred or more, or less, know in United States. We operate a small clandestine unit known as the ‚ÄúLincoln Brigade‚Äù.‚Äù He stared at Jormundson with a deadly serious look on his face.\n> \n> \tJormundson wanted to laugh, but it was strange how serious these three men were being about this subject. To Jormundson the ‚ÄúLincoln Brigade‚Äù was a volunteer group of Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and nothing more. ‚ÄúYou mean like the Lincoln Brigade in Spain?‚Äù offered Jormundson.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúThis is where things get complicated son.‚Äù Jeremy leaned back in his chair, tenting his fingers and then setting them on his arm rests. ‚ÄúIt is the same, and it‚Äôs not. We were founded at the behest of Lincoln during the Civil War, had we been there during his assassination we would have had our founder with us a little longer.‚Äù He closed his eyes almost as if he was remembering that time himself.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúThe LB were in Spain, alongside the ‚ÄúLincoln Brigade‚Äù some drunk fool found the name from one of our more careless agents and loved it, though we are much older. But we were present there, and helped Franco become what he was, shame he didn‚Äôt stay as faithful to us after the war.‚Äù The implications of what Jeremy said were beginning to interest Jormundson.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre saying that Franco was a United States plot?‚Äù Jormundson said asking the question with all the doubt one could show on ones face.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúYes, when a political situation demands quick satisfaction, or a quick hand is needed to ensure the United States prospers, we can provide a quick answer. We don‚Äôt do prolonged struggle, we tip the teetering pyramid in the direction it needs to go.‚Äù\n> \n> \t‚ÄúSo, you are a bunch of assassins?‚Äù Jormundson seemed puzzled by strange interspersed vagueness in a lot of the words. ‚ÄúYou guys are a bunch of Yankee Ninjas?‚Äù\n> \n> \t‚ÄúNot ninjas, the Japanese paid dearly and still do for letting that get out. They had them first, but they were merely a prototype. They don‚Äôt call them that anymore.‚Äù\n> \n> \t‚ÄúWhat do they call them now?‚Äù Jormundson asked.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúThe Hyaku, or the One Hundred.‚Äù Jeremy said matter-of-factly, and there are many more in the world. ‚ÄúThe Russian Tyeni, and the Chinese YinYing, both have their home in the Russian Revolution, coming from the Tsarist Okhrana. The Germans never believed in them and paid for it at the end of WWII, Hitler didn‚Äôt kill himself son. The Tyeni made sure of that.‚Äù Jeremy offered each tidbit as though it were a reward for continued interest in the conversation, and Jormundson was biting.\n> \n> \tJormundson could hardly believe the things he was hearing, being that they flew in the face of conventional knowledge. He knew a lot that the public didn‚Äôt, but this was really left field for even a Secret level CIA conference.\n> \n> \tJeremy continued ‚ÄúThe Indian Svajas face off nearly daily with the Pakistani Uqaab, These Japanese Hyaku face with the South Korean Gonghwadang Geulimja the North Korean Bulg-eun Geulimja, we just call them Gongs and Bulgans for short.‚Äù\n> \n> \t‚ÄúCommunist Ninjas?‚Äù Jormundson asked puzzled by how that sounded.\n> \n> \t‚ÄúYeah, Communist Ninjas.‚Äù Jeremy smiled at the naive question. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an Ideology Jormundson, they are something any country can come up with given enough time.‚Äù Jeremy finished the point before he continued on. ‚ÄúNorway has the l√∏vers, and Sweden the t√§ndande. L√∏ver is Norwegian for Lion, Son.‚Äù Brown eyes who has been quiet since his entrance earlier let out a chuckle. Blue eyes blinked, in what Jormundson was sure was the first time he had done so since they got here.\n> \n> \t‚ÄùYour father was the best the t√§ndande ever had, and they paid him well, but it was a boring life in Sweden. I met him in Hong Kong, having just having been released from The Royal Army and her majesty‚Äôs service, and recently brough on by the LB in the US. We knew about him, and I approached him with an offer, he took it and moved to Minnesota.‚Äù Jeremy began to speak a little less seriously, and seemingly more personal. ‚ÄùHe was a good man, but in the Lincoln Brigade he was involved against the Soviet Tyeni, and got a bit too deep. They evened out the score on Mackinac Bridge twenty years ago.‚Äù Jeremy said this so matter of factly, it threw off Jormundson completely again.\n> \n> -Continued-\n> \n> \t', ""I tell you man, the harmonium, and god, the bells... THE BELLS!\n\nIt all started at the county fair. It was supposed to be a diplomatic visit. The president was supposed to do a quaint meet and greet followed by a photo op with the WI, and the quaint British traditions. Guaranteed to raise the approval rating from the foreign trip. Spawn a couple of think-pieces on the special relationship. That sort of thing. \n\nGod why won't anyone believe me. They came at us with sticks! They tapped Agent Carter on the ankle, and he just fell down shaking, It couldn't have been anaphylactic shock from the Victoria sponge!\n\nThey all moved in this lockstep, dancing towards us spiralling around us. Your eyes were just drawn to the ribbons and hankies, it must have been some sort of hypnosis! I'm telling you! \n\nWhy won't you believe me!\n\nWhat?\n\nI don't know why the crowd was all cheering and clapping. It was fucking creepy, watching their dead eyes and their robotic motions. It must have been some sort of mass hypnosis.\n\nBut what happened next, I couldn't move. There was some sort of weight pinning me down. They skipped I tell you, Skipped up to POTUS, and just tapped him on the forehead. \n\nThey just carried on down the street, the whole gang of them.

Holding it in a secret basement of a hotel hosting an anime convention was a stroke of genius.  Those japanese ninjas had been right, to hide a tree: use a forest. But thier time had passed. They did\'nt change with the times.\n\nThose who hired them knew how to find them.   The international association of Ninja.   The Australian Ninjas were the best in the world, thier mastery of deadly creatrues and harsh terrain made them the most expensive.    The Japanese ninja had fractured into the traditionalists (what normies think of ninja) and the flashy ones who wore orange.    Nobody ever expected Spanish Ninjas or the Canadian ones (they would apologize as they killed you, often by force feeding you maple syrup and poutine until your stomach burst).  With the new assassins creed games more people expected the Arabic, Italian and even the American Ninjas. \n\nIt was at the secret ninja bar that they would trade stories. \n""I say olaf, did you see yesterday\'s episode of Game of Thones?

A little girl with freckles and red hair glared at him ""fer fook\'s sake ye daft coont.   Enough with the spoilers.""    \n\nNigel shook his head distastefuly.  ""Mary, you git!

The maid passing by answered ""No. No..""  thinking to herself ""I take""\n\n\n', '""Oh, here *they* come"" the blonde agent said, his English having a slight accent. Scandinavian, probably.\n\nHis face was hidden behind a generic Guy Fawkes mask. White shirt, black tie, black suit, black shoes, black gloves, electronic watch. The other agent turned her head to see. A woman with a big black sunhat and a bland white mask. Black suit, black boots, black gloves, electronic watch.\n\nShe didn\'t say anything.\n\nFrom everywhere, ninjas appear, in various ninja gear, armed with Howa type 89s and fuckin\' samurai swords, they literally started firing at the convention of literal assassins, again.\n\nNo message, just screaming at you from the start. Every few years they track down a gathering, and just charge it. Not even any demands, no envoy - they\'re never invited anyway. \n\nAlmost everyone at the convention, as if they had been waiting for the moment, snapped into action. Pistols slid out from sleeves, boots and pants all over. Bartenders dove behind the bar, and started throwing assault rifles to the agents. A few odd ones were completely caught off guard, and started freaking out.\n\n""Holy shit"" an American agent, probably Texan, shouted. Probably his first time. He hadn\'t reached for cover because of this, and got shot in the jugular, forehead and abdomen. The ninjas, however, had even less who had survived to learn. The agents had taken up defensive positions, and quickly gained superior fire control. The ninjas had come sliding in from ropes as well, and as they got shot they fell, slamming into the floor. Others had made it down, trying to get a foothold by swamping them with dead ninjas falling from the sky, executing agents point blank and slashing them with samurai swords.\n\nAs usual, after a few volleys, most of them had been neutralised. Some had fallen wounded, but killed themselves where capable instead of risking capture. Some carried grenades. And as usual, once most of them were downed ... All over the place, they\'d explode themselves as they screamed in defiance.\n\nBody parts, blood, concrete, shrapnell flew around. Meanwhile above, a security team had engaged the second wave of ninjas, not succeeding in preventing them from throwing nades down to the lowest floor. By now, the quickest had made it into the other rooms, where they engaged parts of the second wave. \n\nIn all this, the Scandinavian agent, sat almost paralysed behind the bar, clenching his Glock 17, trying to cover his ears.\n\nHe was surrounded by dead bartenders, as the rest had now fled, as the ground shook and dust flew around. ""F√∂rl√•t mig, Herre"" he heaved through his tears, rocking around, his shoulder bleeding heavily. The agent with the bland white mask had lost her black sunhat by now, revealing her dark brown hair and fair complexion.\n\n ""Upp, upp lilla tik"" she screamed as she dragged at his arm ""J√§vla skitt"" as a nade blew half the bar away. ""Upp!""\n\n""Jag √§r knullad, de har skjutit mig"" he groaned \n\n""Jag √§r inte j√§vla blind, tjockskalle, g√• upp om du inte vill att vi ska d√∂, j√§vla"" she screamed right into his face. That got him up, and they stumbled over the bodies into the other room.\n\nI push the button now that only ninjas remain, and gas starts filling the room,  killing them as their circulatory system feels as if its on fire, and their lungs shut down. That\'s another generation of ninjas we won\'t have to deal with, I think as I push back against my desk, so I can see the vast myriad of security cameras.\n\nNinja raids gave him a great commission.', ""**The Family...**\n\nThe Family is a secretive group the works with assassins to influence the world. They're a secret program developed by a company, though I don't know which. From what we were taught, it was originally developed to be a private assassination squad that would target key figures from the company's rivals. As time continued on and the world changed, the group expanded its scope of operations. They stopped training their own assassination squads and began blackmailing preexisting assassins...\n\nThe program has changed since that was implemented but not by much...\n\nHow they pick their candidates is unknown, me and my buddy were veterans they picked up. We had done some... less than morally correct things during our service. When The Family approached us, we didn't have much of a choice due to the blackmailing. The job pays good, which is nice, but there's certain drawbacks - as with every job.\n\nThere's a ranking list, over 300 operatives across the globe and all of them in competition with each other. While the murder of fellow operatives is strictly forbidden, the sabotage of missions for others is not. If you get too low on the ranking board, lose your rank, you're *tied* up. No need to support inadequate members in service...\n\nThose lower on the ranking list are sent to Japan for their missions. Lots of people there, lots of escape routes too - the perfect hunting ground of the inexperienced. Unfortunately, when you perform better you get shipped out to other posts in various countries. At least, that's how it use to be until The Family began expanding again. Rather than having independent branches in various territories to blend in, it's began interlinking them - combining them.\n\nThe problem this poses for people like me and others ranked lower on the listings, the more interconnected they are - they less there is a need for operatives in every section. Fewer operative means more heads will role and I and few others might end up on the chopping block...\n\nI need to leave, I can't keep my contacts waiting..."", 'Harry made his way down the long hallway with bated breath. He\'d never been called to the big boss\' office before, but he had seen others come back from there just to pack up their desk and hand in their badge. Was he headed the same way? His last mission had been a close call, but damn it, he\'d made it work. \nAs he wiped his forehead, the door ahead swung open. Harry made the final steps towards it and looked through the open doorway. There was nothing there. No chair, no desk, no people, not even a window. The gut feeling that had saved him from countless deadly situations kicked in once more. He leaned back to read the sign beside the door, but it hadn\'t changed in the last few seconds. \n""Detective Harry Blackwell,"" boomed a loud voice from inside the room, startling Harry who instinctively reached for his gun. His hand remained empty, as both holster and gun were safely stowed away at his desk. \n""Enter,"" the voice dictated.\nHis curiosity got the better of him, and he stepped inside the empty room. As soon as he passed the threshold the door swung shut behind him. \n""Is this some kind of joke?"" He said out loud. Chief Daniels had been the one to send him down here, but he had less of a sense of humor than a chicken. \n""This,"" answered the voice, ""is your chance to become more powerful than you ever thought possible. All you have to do, is find me."" Find who? And in an empty room no less.\n\nWhile listening, Harry had been searching for the source of the voice. It seemed to come from multiple hidden speakers, but it was hard to tell as the sound reverberated off the bare walls. \nThe room was dimly lit by a small lamp hanging from the ceiling. It was too weak to reach the furthest corners so he decided to try his luck there first. Alas, all four corners contained nothing but dust. If this was some sort of mystery room, shouldn\'t there at least be something, anything\xa0 to give him a clue? Harry turned back towards the door and discovered a light switch. He flipped it and all was pitch black. However, for the briefest of moments, he saw a narrow beam of light in the far left corner. Or had it been a trick of the mind? \n\nHe turned the lights back on and made his way across the room once more. As before, there was nothing but dust, but that light... had it been there? \n""What is this shit?"" He asked in frustration. No answer. \nHarry knelt down to examine where the floor and walls joined. As he hovered his fingers over the corner, he felt a breeze of air. Reaching into his back pocket, Harry found his trusted pocket knife. His dad had gifted the knife to him on his 10th birthday and he\'d been carrying it around ever since. \nHe unfolded the knife and slid it between the wall and floor. With one wiggle of the blade and an audible click, the two walls came apart in a narrow slit. Harry took one last look behind him, into the dimly lit room, and then pushed the walls completely apart. Behind them was a steep staircase leading downwards into darkness. \n""Guess I\'m doing this, huh."" He said and stepped down. The stairs were so narrow, he had to take them sideways. The further down he went, the darker it became, till it was pitch black. With his hand on the wall in front of him and careful steps, he made his way down the stairs, till he\'d reached the end. \n""Congratulations."" Harry jolted in shock at the low whisper, realizing it came from right behind him. \n""Who\'s there?"" He asked with hands raised, ready for combat. \n""Relax,"" the voice said, now coming from straight in front of him. ""I won\'t hurt you."" At once, a lamp was lit and Harry could see the owner of the voice: it was a tall man, dressed in a crisp, gray suit. \n""What is this?"" Harry had never seen this man before and it sure as hell wasn\'t the big boss. \n""Well, detective, we\'ve been following your career and it is time that you join our ranks and become a ninja.""\n""Fuck you!"" Harry exclaimed. So this was a joke after all. He turned in anger to leave up the stairs, but in a split second, his path was blocked by the stranger. \n""What the...?"" Harry mumbled. The other man had moved with a pace that simply wasn\'t possible. \n""Leave now and your time in the force is over. Stay, and you will learn the ninja ways."" \n""Ninja ways? This is the God damn US of A, not Japan. Cut the crap and tell me what\'s going on."" As he watched, the tall man seemed to fade from sight until he was no longer visible. \n""This is what\'s going on."" Harry felt chills running down his spine. Had he really just seen a man disappear before his eyes? He reached out to where the man had been and jerked back as he made contact with the unseeable man\'s body. \n""What? How is that even possible?"" Harry stuttered, while searching for proof of this thing being a magic trick. Mirrors, string, anything.\n\n""I\'m a ninja,"" said the invisible stranger, ""and you can be one too.""', ""Okay, so first things first... What the hell am I doing right now? I find this old diary in a rundown piece of shit someone called a house in the middle of the woods! I swear there must have been some drugs in that tea I drank. So you've heard of the CIA right? Yea well I bet you haven't heard of the TAC. Technology advanced combatants. To put it into perspective we are basically the ninjas of the United States of America. In fact writing in this compromises everything I have been taught but who cares about this shitty ol journal anyway. To be honest even us TAC need a break from reality. In just the past 4 months Ive had 42 secure operations. Sometimes I wish I could go back to the summer of 2073 as things were... Less complicated.

Extermination maybe. Though I‚Äôd more aptly describe it as a harvest. By the time they reached our world and penetrated the stratosphere, people sought them out in droves to be harvested. Of course, they knew what that actually meant. Otherwise, they wouldn‚Äôt have been so eager.\n\nTen years before the *Angels* descended from the sky, they had already sent what some referred to as divine retribution: a virus. Though this virus in particular only targeted women. It spread faster than a wildfire and had a 100% mortality rate. Worse yet, it was completely undetectable. In our desperation, we became animals. We locked our wives, daughters, and mothers deep underground under the constant shine of UV radiation and still they got infected. Within five years, the last woman had died leaving the rest of humanity to slowly die with her.\n\nBy the time they arrived, we welcomed them with open arms into every one of our major cities. Most bowed their heads and practically begged to be killed. Some fought against them. These were the ones that still remembered the pain of watching their daughters, wives, and mothers die. They couldn‚Äôt hope to survive, but at least they could enact their own version of divine retribution.\n\nLooking back at it now, I know that the *Angels* planned for them. They wanted us to retaliate. Otherwise, where would be the fun? Men charged at them by the millions. Some to die. Some to kill. To the *Angels*, it was all the same.\n\nUntil we killed the first one.\n\nBack when I used to write, I always made sure to name my hero something memorable. If not a strange name, then certainly a strange title. Evan the Incorruptible. Matthew the Harbinger. But in real life, heroes rarely have titles, some don‚Äôt even have names. That was the case for humanity‚Äôs last hero because nobody knew who he was.\n\nWe had only stories. The stories ranged from fantastical to downright fiction, but they always ended the same. We had killed one. The *Angels* must‚Äôve been as skeptical as we were because they refused to change their tactics. They kept all our major cities and welcomed anyone to try and take it back.\n\nBy the fifth dead *Angel*, they learned of their miscalculation. Soon, we learned of it as well. Human beings shared mana and with it, we could do wondrous or terrible things. Magic no longer belonged to the realm of fiction. The elements bent to our will. Lightning struck where we pointed, tornados formed where we stood, the ground swallowed up entire cities as we willed it.\n\nSuddenly, men stopped volunteering to be harvested. With their newfound power, they decided to fight back, even if victory had already been stolen from us. They had turned us into animals and then backed us into a corner. Foolish.\n\nAnd that was good enough for us. Looking back, I wonder if we were as foolish as the *Angels*. We, who were content with dying in our little blazes of glory, having accomplished nothing but thinning their ranks by just a bit. It was selfish, but what is there to expect from men who had nothing else to live for?\n\nNone of us had the vision you had. The vision you have.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nTyler put the pen down, staring at the word *you*. He wondered if his letter would ever find its way to this certain *you*. While humanity had become animals, one man had gone even further. He had been called a monster by both *Angel* and man. Nobody knew which side he fought for, only that he killed both indiscriminately.\n\nIf Tyler were to write his story, he wouldn‚Äôt know whether to make this man the villain or the hero. Oh how he wished he could‚Äôve written this story, but the only way this story continued was if he died. Beside his letter and pen, sitting at the edge of his wooden table was a silver revolver. The single lightbulb above him glinted off its barrel.\n\nA small grin spread across Tyler‚Äôs face. He grabbed the gun, its metal like ice, and pressed it to his temple. Enough humans had died where he could stop the bullet with only his thoughts. The bullet couldn‚Äôt even hurt him unless he wanted it to. But he did. For the sake of humanity, he needed the bullet to kill him.\n\nWith his free hand, he picked the pen back up.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nAs the last storyteller on Earth, I bestow you the title of Reaper. A monster. A villain. Our last hero.\n\nGo forth, Reaper, my death as an offering. With my passing, there will be only four humans left. I have already contacted two of them and they will die with me. The last I‚Äôm sure you will easily find as your powers will have increased two-fold. By then, your mind will stretch the globe, perhaps even the stars. And when you become the last human alive, I cannot even fathom how powerful you will be.\n\nShow our *Angels* how fragile they are in the face of a god.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nTyler pulled the trigger.\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang\n\n---\n\nPart 1 | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/jraywang/comments/7i53fr/reaper_part_2/) | [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/jraywang/comments/7iavci/reaper_part_3/) | [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/jraywang/comments/7iokx3/reaper_part_4/)\n\n\n', '[**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/7nlhae/the_blood_of_angry_men_part_2/)\n***\n***The Blood of Angry Men***\n\n**Part 1**\n\n\nAll us helpless billions watch on our little glowing rectangles as the human race dies in droves. They fall screaming, choking, burning. The internet‚Äôs bad in the house, so me and my brother and sisters hunker on the steps of the chicken coop to see it.\n\nTogether we watch the end of the world. Our breath clouds and storms around us. But we do not notice the cold. Our hearts and bones are lead.\n\nMy siblings don‚Äôt make a sound. I look between the three of them and the black, faultless sky. I wonder if the afterlife looks like night, or if just looks like nothing. I wonder if I‚Äôll find out soon.\n\nSomewhere far away, death shrieks scarlet overhead. Ships with roving eyes swarm the sky like an army of locusts. Bodies, whole and unwhole, strewn out one atop the other, abandoned where they fell. Entire skyscrapers collapse like dominoes. News anchors weep, openly, if they‚Äôre on the air at all. My sister flicks restlessly through live streams, unable to pick which tragedy to behold.\n\nWe crowd my oldest sister‚Äôs phone, barely able to watch yet unable to look away.\n\nShe stops at the live press conference from the president. His voice is grave and hollow; he speaks to us from a dark room in some bunker somewhere. He says, ‚Äú‚Äîat this point we have little hope. We will defend ourselves to the end, but tonight, please, stay inside, stay with your loved ones‚Äî‚Äù\n\nMy brother Aaron has his head between his knees. When we were kids he ran screaming after the cougar that took his puppy. (Aaron didn\'t catch it.) I never believed fear was an emotion he had. ‚ÄúTurn that shit off,‚Äù he gasps.\n\n‚ÄúIgnoring the aliens invading our fucking planet won‚Äôt make them go away,‚Äù Maya snaps but she switches to Facebook. Not that any of her friends would have time to post *oh shit I‚Äôm dying*, anyway.\n\nOut here, under the unblinking stars, surrounded by a chorus of crickets and coyote, I can‚Äôt fathom what waits out there.\n\n‚ÄúSomeone has to tell Papa,‚Äù Jackie murmurs. She is my twin, but you can‚Äôt tell. People always seem disappointed that there‚Äôs such a thing as non-identical twin sisters.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll just scare him.‚Äù Maya, the oldest, has always been the unofficial boss of all of us. She made it official when Dad started mistaking her for our mother and trying to scramble uncracked eggs. \n\n‚ÄúHe deserves to know,‚Äù she insists.\n\n‚ÄúIf they come here,‚Äù Maya says through her teeth, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not getting a panicked old man into the truck without hurting someone, alright?‚Äù Her words hang frozen for a moment.\n\n‚ÄúDo you think they‚Äôll come out here?‚Äù I whisper. I am the youngest by eight minutes, and I am good at the part. \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù says Jackie, quickly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere.‚Äù\n\nAaron pulls his beanie over his eyes. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt rule it out, Jack.‚Äù\n\nMaya gasps into her fingers. ‚ÄúOh, god, they‚Äôre in Spokane.‚Äù\n\nBile shoots up my throat. That‚Äôs barely a hundred miles from here. Not even a particularly large city. I wonder if they‚Äôre hunting us one by one. Like rabbits.\n\n‚ÄúShit, is that Maddie‚Äôs‚Äî?‚Äù Aaron snatches the phone from her hands. \n\nI lean over his shoulder to see. \n\nMy sister‚Äôs friend has pressed her phone lens to the window of her dorm room. In the background, she speaks in rapid, panicked whispers with her roommate.\n\nOutside her window mortars plummet in blue and yellow streaks, big as bowling balls. I hear her cry, ‚ÄúAre they bombing us?‚Äù as the first one connects. It blooms soundlessly, a pale yellow locus, and then the power of it explodes outward. \n\nIt takes Maddie maybe six seconds to die. She has enough time to say, ‚ÄúI need to call my mom,‚Äù as the wall of smoke and debris rushes toward her like a sulfurous tsunami. The window shatters. The video goes black.\n\nI don‚Äôt even realize what I‚Äôve seen until Maya starts bawling into her hands.\n\nA strange fire tingles in my palms, my belly. I feel the urge to move. To rise and fight.\n\n‚ÄúWe have to do *something*,‚Äù I say.\n\nAaron looks at me like I‚Äôm an idiot. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù\n\nMy fingers dance against the leg of my jeans. I know I should be scared as hell, but something in me is restless. Hungry for something very old, and long-forgotten.\n\nI stand up and face my siblings. I look them over carefully, in case this is the last time I see them. ‚ÄúWe will not just watch.‚Äù I point at the house. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt just let them kill everything and everyone and just stand here and *watch*.‚Äù\n\nJust south of us, down beyond the hide of the mountain, the sky turns red with fire.\n\nTears stream down my brother‚Äôs cheeks. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this is fucking it.‚Äù\n\nI shake my head, insistently. Insanely. I don‚Äôt know why, but I can‚Äôt accept that this *is* it. That this is truly how we fall. \n\nI ball my fists up at my sides. A furious heat snaps at the bars of my ribs, yearning to set on those who dared attack our home, of all places. Our dad, of all people. \n\nI let the hate and heat fill me. \n\nFlame chases down my forearm, over my knuckles. The white hot of anger. My fist is a coal and my flesh is carved from the mountain, and I will destroy anything that threatens the ones I love.\n\n‚ÄúAvis,‚Äù my brother says, oddly calm, ""why is your hand glowing?""\n\nI look at my palm and grin. The fire finds my belly now. The chaos delights some new-awoken part of me that I had never known I possessed. It is like catching my reflection in an angle I have never seen before. I am myself, but different.\n\n‚ÄúI think...‚Äù I laugh, despite the clouds of smoke rising from town. It rises out of me like a bird. I have never felt smaller or stronger. ‚ÄúI think I did it on purpose.‚Äù\n\n***\n\n\nMaya drives me because she won\'t let me leave by myself. Aaron stays back with Dad, probably to watch DVR\'d game shows with him and pretend everything is fine. Jackie lies in the backseat and lets out this low, constant groan of pure horror until Maya shrieks at her to shut up.\n\nThe truck flies down the mountain, towards the billowing columns of ash and fire. I stare at my palms, which well with blue fire like water. It licks down my hands and pools on the floor mats, where it vanishes like steam.\n\n""Can you put that out or something? It\'s freaky.""\n\n""I don\'t know if I can get it back,"" I say, truthfully. ""I don\'t even know why it\'s happening.""\n\n""Goddamn alien radiation,"" my sister mutters under her breath, like she has any real clue what\'s going on. ""That\'s the only thing that makes sense.""\n\nMaya takes the corner by the Hendersons\' farm too fast. The tires skid and shriek but just manage to cling onto the road. We keep going.\n\n""I think we have to stop hoping for things to make sense,"" I murmur.\n\nWe are silent for the rest of the drive down the mountain. The burning thing in me paces like a fox. I want to feed it flesh and bone. If the aliens are even like us. If they\'re just a little fire of a soul trapped in a suit of meat.\n\nBut the more we drive the stronger I feel. The hotter the fire in me.\n\nWhen we make it to the base of the mountain, a row of fire trucks from the reservation streaks past us on the freeway, sirens blaring. I want to tell them to turn around, that they should be getting people out who still have time to run, not throwing themselves into the chaos like a sacrifice. Like we\'re going to do.\n\nBeyond the lake, the city is flames. The lakeside resort burns, a stalwart skeleton. Even the boats are burning. Rotten orange clouds choke the sky. Ships weave in and out of the gloom, dropping bright streaking bombs that fall glittering like jewels. \n\nFor a moment we just sit, truck running, staring.\n\n""They won\'t find us at home,"" Jackie says.\n\n""There won\'t be a home anymore if they burn the damn forest down."" I scowl out the windshield. ""It\'s okay. I can walk from here.""\n\nMaya shakes her head. ""It\'s five miles at least, Av.""\n\n""It\'s a good night for a walk.""\n\nMy sister presses her forehead against the steering wheel and breathes hard through her nose. Then she turns on her turn signal--that\'s what kind of person my sister Maya is; she uses her turn signal even during intergalactic genocide--and heads after the firetrucks. Toward town.\n\n""I love you,"" she says without looking at me. ""But I\'m gonna be real pissed if you get us killed.""\n***\n/r/shoringupfragments\n\n##[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/7nlhae/the_blood_of_angry_men_part_2/)', ""I awoke in the night, the distant sounds of screams altogether too familiar. It didn't sound isolated - they must have found a safe-haven. Hundreds would be massacred. It was just like I said; don't bunch together. Don't rely on each other for support. Survival is all about laying low, keeping quiet and hoping that luck was on your side. \n\nI'd been having a strange dream. It wasn't a nightmare, which was rare already; it was more of a premonition. I'd felt a burning sensation in my hand, as if there were energy coursing through it. The feeling still stuck with me, and I focused on it to try drown out the screams.\n\n********\n\nThere were more of them now; towering beasts, eldritch monstrosities. We'd imagined aliens as these advanced beings, visiting us with technology that we could not even comprehend, bestowing knowledge and gifts. But no.\n\nThey were unimaginable nightmares, drifting in through space, landing on our forsaken planet and hunting us mercilessly. Our combined efforts only took down a few, and the ensuing nuclear winter only made things worse. And now they hunt us down without rest. It doesn't seem to be for sustenance - they ignore other animals, though they will harm them if it is in their way. No; it feels like eradication. And more come every day. \n\nBut the the dreams won't go away. What little sleep I have is filled with feelings of flame and fury; of ominous premonition, of terrifying power. I feel that energy more and more. I suspect that I am going mad, but I'd rather be mad than dead. And judging by my travels, it seems that I am one of the few left with the privilege of choice. \n\nSleep comes to me eventually, the incessant chittering of the aliens filtering through my dreams of intrigue, of primal power.\n\n*****\n\nI awoke to a sound of crashing, of beastly lumbering. \n\n*I've been found.*\n\nI sprinted from my lair, a crumbling ruin, just as a jagged tentacle pierced through the foundations. Rubble collapsed around me as I leapt through a window, landing on the floor below in a clumsy roll. There was no time to think about the pain - only escape. \n\nI ran as fast as I could, praying that it was only one, praying that it could not keep up. There were many different forms of alien, and most of the massive ones were slow in the city. They could run at least as fast as a man, but the buildings and ruins proved ample obstacles. With a bit of luck, I could survive this. I had done so before.\n\nA sudden crash to my right sent glass flying just ahead of me. An arthropod the size of a large dog landed in front of me, its razor-sharp legs digging into the floor. There was no chance of running from it. But if I climbed the building to avoid it, my pursuer would destroy it as if it was a cardboard box. I had two choices, but either led to death. \n\nMy right hand burned, a sharp red glow emitting from my palm. It felt like trapped electricity. Like every bit of primal power focused into a single thought.\n\nA choice:\n\nShall I **fight**, or **flee**?\n\n****\n\n[Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/7i4fn8/wp_resurge_ii/) | [Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/7i4p1p/wp_resurgence_iii/) | [Part IV (new)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/7i65tc/wp_resurgence_iv/)\n\nIt's a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' story!

They seemed well versed in warfare, in less than a day there wasn't a satellite left in the sky or a cable under the sea. Communication between nations fell to old ground bounce long range radios pulled out of mothballs. Conventional weapons proved to be ineffective and the nuclear option didn't fare much better. Eventually even the old analog radios where jammed. Steadily they started to wipe us out. Great mechanized beasts roamed the land, directed energy weapons reduced any caught in there sight to ash. \n\nSlowly word began to spread of old legends come to light. Wizards, witches even warlocks making pacts with demons to gain power. Men and women alike where seen calling fourth searing bolts of lighting from the sky. Ripping the ground open to devour and crush any of the aliens creations that wandered to close to the last bastions of humanity. Liquefying the great metal monsters with conjured fire. Even death was no relief to our fallen comrades as the necromancers raised forth gargantuan armies of the dead. Crushing the invaders with the sheer mass of rotting meat and gleaming bone. As our species continued to fight for our existence more of the things that go bump in the night started coming to light.\n\nAt first they appeared to be fellow humans but it soon became clear that was not the case. The first were the Werewolves, nigh unkillable but by blessed silver. Transforming into great beasts they used claws and teeth to rend through armor only magic could penetrate. These furry juggernauts relied on humans not for food as in the old tales but as breeding stock. As we continued to dwindle in number they could no longer stalk the shadows. Though small in numbers they made up for it in shear brutality. Soon all of the others concealed in the shadows made themselves known. The vampires where less well received than the wolves but in the end they needed us. Becoming a donor for one elevated ones physically abilities for a time. Though to somes disappointment, crosses, sunlight and garlic did not faze them.\n\nThe Fae became another ally though much less trustful, one had to be cautious when speaking with them. Never make an open ended bargain with one, it never ends in your favor. Whatever the invaders mechanized army consisted of it was not iron and they seemed to take much glee in the wanton destruction they could wield. Many hopped the elves and dwarves of some fairy tales would come to be but to this day none have materialized. Though the dragons made there presence known they more are focused on what little territory they still held and if you happen to occupy it you have one hell of a home security system. Rumblings of the old gods walking among man once more have been heard but not verified. \n\nAs of now hope has yet to completely die for humanity and its newly rediscovered allies. While the dragons and invaders still rule the skies we have done much to retake the land. The current status of humanity as a whole is still not truly known, while magic is useful as a weapons it does not give it self over willingly to be used to pass missives. Communication over the oceans and across continents is still a slow process and we are just starting to retake the seas. \n\n-Field Commander, 3rd Magus Division, Capt Jasper D.

I was in one of these so called safe houses, if a sewer tunnel filled with lamps and sleeping bags counts as a house, that I first heard these claims.\n\nLeft that particular house after that conversation, it wasn\'t safe. The bastards killed everyone there, by the time I returned the tunnel had collapsed. No signs of life anywhere.\n\n4 weeks ago humanity was attacked by a race of unknown origin. Humanity fought back but it was useless. These things, or ""clickers"" as the survivor colonies refer to them due to their habit of releasing a strange clicking sound, ever seen that movie Predator? Like the predator clicks. Anyway these clickers were ruthless and brutally efficient. Russia was the first major nation to go down, falling in only 7 hours, soon all of Asia was conquered. Fast forwards 4 weeks and humans have become rats, running through tunnels, breaching the surface only for food or water. \n\nUnder earth is safer than above it. I don\'t know why but they hate it underground, they won\'t search through tunnels too often.  But if they know someone\'s there they will come.\n\nOn this particular day I was sleeping in an above ground safe house. More accurately in one of the cars of an abandoned military train. The thing was perfect, armored, still functioning partway so it was warm and could lock up very tightly. I was bundled in my sleeping bag in a car that had the doors sealed tight. I had awoken from a sound I had heard outside. Namely the gunshots.\n\nThat was about 30 minutes ago. But 2 minutes previously I thought I had heard a familiar clicking. I inhaled and sure enough the stench of motor oil and salt water hit my nostrils, an odd odor that clickers emitted. \n\nSuddenly the side of the car rattled as someone, or something, tried to open the door. It rattled a few more times before there was a bang that blasted the door into pieces. \n\nThe clicker regarded me, I don\'t actually know what the things look like, they\'re always wearing the same armor, rectangular slabs of metal. It raised a serrated blade and charged. \n\nI stumbled backwards and my left hand fell into an open control panel full of wires I had to cut to disable the alarm systems on the cars. There was still electricity in those cables. I was expecting a massive pain, I\'d maybe to blackout. What I wasn\'t expecting was for the energy to travel down my arm and then blast from my other hand straight into the clicker. Whatever metal that armor was apparently conducted electricity as the clicker shrieked, then collapsed into the ground, smoke pouring from in between the plates. \n\nI looked at my hand, blue energy danced from my fingers, suddenly a loud howl broke the eerie silence, a howl that meant a clicker had heart the blast. The things were slow, I likely had 5 minutes. I had packed my bag and was about to go when I glanced at the dead clicker. Curiosity struck but I still needed to get away.\n\nDo I: Run or Investigate the Body\nEdit: continuing story. \n\nI ran over to the thing, maybe finally a chance to see what they looked like, that metal was probably valuable as well. I looked all over the armor and finally found a small blue pad on the neck, I pressed it and with hissing steam the plates folded away revealing the front of the thing.\n\nI understood now why they covered their faces. The skin was like tanned cow hide, it was covered in what looks like blisters. The eyes were dark and hollow. The worst part was the mandible jaw. Strangely if the mandible jaw was closed the creature might look human. \n\nThe howling got louder. I remembered I was on a schedule, I grabbed anything that looked useful. An odd device that looked like  a flashlight with a grip and trigger, a few plates of armor, and the blade it had held. A blade that resembled a knife sized serrated Khopesh. \n\nNow I had picked up a few tricks since this whole thing went down, one of which was that most clickers with the exception of a few that has been wearing red plates instead of black, seemed to be blind. A scientist I had met in the first week said the clicking was echolactation, wait that wasn\'t it... Oh who cares. \n\nThey relied on smell to distinguish each other and that armor still had the salty oil smell. I put the plates back  into place, with a groan hoisted the dead clicker out, lay down in the armor and pressed the blue button.\n\nThe layers closed down and everything was dark, of course if these things things were blind a visor wasn\'t needed. The second thing I noticed was that there was still a LOT of electricity surging through the armor.\n\nNow I\'m no scientist but I\'m fairly certain I should have been cooked alive. No time for that now. I tried to tear the helmet off and somehow succeeded. I sprinted out of there, the armor surprisingly light, snagging my pack under my arm as I ran. \n\n7 years, and many incinerations, electrocutions, crushings, and drownings later the clickers finally retreated. Leaving behind only a strange gold box, oddly resembling an Egyptian coffin. Nobody could open it. I walked up to it and slid the blade I\'d carried for seven years into a small slot in the box. It clicked and opened and I was staring at my own dead body...\n\nRoger woke with a start. ""Okay that\'s it, no more pizza before sleep.""', 'There is a crucial aspect to conflict one must remember above all else; when victory is the desired outcome, all costs must be put on the line. If you truly seek your goal, you must be willing to sacrifice everything. Because if it comes down to it, that moment when you must choose between victory and survival‚Ä¶ the choice must be obvious.\n\n---\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do it without him. Not that the task was impossible with only one person, but the sheer magnitude of the decision, the guilt of suffering the consequences ‚Äì it was too much for my morality to endure. I still harbor some resentment, and I wish there was another way. But I have no regrets. If it was necessary, I‚Äôd do it all again. The gnawing at the back of my head, telling me I was selfish and incompetent, never stopped. I accept it as punishment for my sin. No amount of atonement could justify the deaths of so many.\n\nI find it hard to believe, myself. The display had counted 7.9 billion ‚Äì the outcome was so harsh that it was easier to count the survivors than try to comprehend the casualties.\n\nI suppose I must start at the beginning.\n\n---\n\nMy name is Daijiro Kojima. I grew up in Moni, a country town at the foot of a mountain. Our people disliked the modern world, and chose to abstain from the technologies of the so-called Western Man. My brother Kentaro disproved of this very much. He scolded our chief often for being ‚Äúancient‚Äù and ‚Äúdictatorial.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt disagree with his accusations, as they were, to an extent, true. We held to old customs, and we clung to the advice and teachings of our chief. It was unsafe to wander outside the fence, thanks to the wolves roaming the forest, so we were largely restricted to wandering the farms and the streets. It was a peaceful life, though, and we ate well in the company of our families.\n\nEvery week we gathered to pay tribute to the Effigy of the Mount, feeding it the fruits of our farms and cattle so it could sustain us with bountiful harvests. I didn‚Äôt know how, but the soil here was‚Ä¶ different. To this day I was unsure of it, perhaps being a trick of the light or just my imagination, but the ground seemed to give off an ever so faint glow under the moon, just barely noticeable. I attributed the glow to be the spirit of the mount moving in the ground. Every year we reaped rewards that far exceeded the effort we put in.\n\nWe thanked the chief for his leadership, and we thanked the mount for its generosity. We were merry and happy.\n\n---\n\nKentaro and I always trained with the village guardsmen, learning how to use the sword and be fleet of foot. The latter skills were always emphasized, as the chief said that our swordsmanship would be no match for the weapons of the outside world. The elders, those who travelled across the land and meditated in the fields, told us stories of the Western Man ‚Äì I always wondered about the term, as they were apparently to the East and North too, even the South where the ocean is. Why call them Western if they are everywhere? But, I digress. The elders told us of the extensive range of their armaments, and the frightening speed of their attacks. It was something out of a magic story, I was sure. Kentaro told me he would protect me if the Western Man came to our village, but I always shrugged him off. We were both past childhood anyway. I was more than capable of protecting myself.\n\nBut I never expected us to be the ones killing them.\n\n---\n\nIt happened while I was picking a primrose for mother. I‚Äôd been growing one behind one of the storehouses, so it would be kept a surprise. She loved flowers, especially pink ones. It would make the perfect birthday present. It became dark so suddenly that I thought a vine had torn off the storehouse and fallen over me, but I looked up to see the clouds break apart and disappear, absorbed into a blackened sky. It was dark as night, and I stumbled through the leaves towards light. After feeling along the sides of building walls along the street for a while, amidst panicking women and screaming children, I found myself in the village square. Guards ran to and for with torches, yelling to each other and ushering civilians to safety. I saw my father carrying boxes with some other men. I was confused ‚Äì why was the sky black? Had the sun run away before the moon was ready to wake? Was the Mount angry at us?\n\nAnd then Kentaro was by my side.\n\n‚ÄúHey, Dai‚Ä¶ everything‚Äôs going to be okay, hear me? We‚Äôll figure this out.‚Äù\n\nI nodded. The chief stumbled past with a heavy box, but my brother caught him by the shoulder.\n\n‚ÄúHey, old man, what‚Äôs going on? Where‚Äôs the light gone?‚Äù\n\nEyes wide, the chief turned to us. ‚ÄúGet everyone you can find and gather them at the effigy. I had no idea they would return, not at a time like this.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? Are we under attack?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain everything later. The most important thing now is to get everyone to safety. Here,‚Äù he fumbled in his pocked for a second and retrieved a small object, shoving it into Kentaro‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúTake this. Offer it to the effigy as you would a tribute. We need to protect everyone we can.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou got it, old man. Come on, Dai.‚Äù\n\nSo we took a torch and scampered about, sending everyone we could at the effigy. Mother showed up too, and I suddenly remembered the primrose I‚Äôd left behind the storehouse. She asked about our father, and we didn‚Äôt see him there. More of the guardsmen were arriving, and he wasn‚Äôt among them. Kentaro and I left to look for him, starting first at the barracks then progressing through the streets. We figured he‚Äôd gone to the effigy while we were searching, so we started heading back. However, as we passed a farm we saw a dozen or so men staring at the sky. We followed their gaze and there, in the air above us, we saw the blackness move. It seemed to bend and shift, as if it was a giant piece of cartilage. Parts of it seemed to brighten slightly, and I saw a multitude of small specks appearing from the lighter parts. I watched as the specks grew larger, then realized they were distant objects heading towards us. Kentaro put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n‚ÄúDai‚Ä¶ we should go.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ what are those? Birds?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhatever they are, it can‚Äôt be good.‚Äù\n\nFor a second there was a bright flash amidst the objects, and a split second later the farmers screamed. The dirt around them erupted, spewing mounds of soil into the air. They scrambled back, running for the effigy. Kentaro and I didn‚Äôt hesitate any longer. When we returned, the chief was waiting for us, more stressed than I‚Äôd ever seen him.\n\n‚ÄúYou left and took the key with you?! Do you have any idea of the risk you just put us in?!‚Äù His loud voice drew several eyes from those around us.\n\n‚ÄúOh, sorry‚Ä¶ this thing, right?‚Äù Kentaro drew out the object he‚Äôd been given before. It was about half the size of his palm, colored black and shaped like a disc, engraved with the face of a cat, just like the one on the effigy. They say that black cats are a sign of good fortune. And by the looks of things, we‚Äôre going to need all the fortune we can get.\n\n‚ÄúYes yes yes ‚Äì give it here!‚Äù The chief snatched the disc from Kentaro‚Äôs hand and hurried over to the effigy, dropping it in the tribute slot. The disc would travel down a pipe and end up‚Ä¶ somewhere. I was unsure of where the tributes ended up but I was certain it wasn‚Äôt underneath the chief‚Äôs house like some kids had joked.\n\n‚ÄúWhat now, old man?‚Äù Kentaro asked, arms on his hips.\n\n‚ÄúKen, show some respect.‚Äù Father said, appearing from the group to slap Kentaro across the back.\n\n‚ÄúS-sorry, chief.‚Äù\n\nThe chief was silent, instead speaking with a sly grin. The earth shook, forcing me to steady myself on Kentaro‚Äôs arm. The effigy broke open, splitting the cat‚Äôs face in two. There were several loud gasps and outcries from those gathered, but the chief urged them to calm down. The cracked effigy left a big hole in the ground, laden with steps that seemed to descend to the center of the earth.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone, follow me! Carry everything you can!‚Äù The chief yelled, rushing down the hole and disappearing into the darkness, followed by the residents from the village. I looked back to the objects in the sky, which were approaching all the while. They must‚Äôve been a hundred miles when we first saw them, but I was sure they were a mere couple miles away now.\n\nI felt a pair of hands gripping my shoulders, moving me forward. ‚ÄúCome on, Dai, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù Kentaro had a huge smile on his face, eyes wide.\n\n‚ÄúBrother..?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis is exciting, right? Something different is happening!‚Äù Did he fail to notice the power of those things? Exploding the ground from so far away in an instant? He always was a strange one, I suppose. \n\nSo we descended the steps, each of us carrying a box of supplies. Food, I think. We travelled for maybe 10 minutes, and I felt the temperature slowly dropping. I looked up and could no longer see the entrance nor feel the rumbling from the explosions. Eventually we reached a flat area of dirt, about the size of a house interior. The whole village crowded there, staring at the large wall opposite the end of the steps. It was made of metal, and shined so clearly that in the light of the torches, we could see our reflections. The wall was adorned with strange markings and indentations. The chief walked up to it, putting a hand against it. He sighed, as if in disappointment. I saw his lips move, but he made no sound.\n\n**PART TWO IN CHILD COMMENT**', ""I don't know how to start here. None of this makes any sense.\n\nI grew up watching the old Superman movies on tape. I grew up wanting to be like the man himself; I always thought I'd do what he did if I ended up with his powers. I remember fantasizing about it maybe a week before first contact; it was a thought I had often. \n\nI told myself I'd skip the subtext and buy an actual Superman costume online before I went flying around the world chucking nukes into deep space and putting out forest fires. So that when people saw me coming, they'd know I was coming to help. \n\nThere are a few problems with that now. The first one that comes to mind is, there's no one left to impress like that. The other six survivors don't need or want Superman right now, besides, you guys are all as invincible as I am.\n\nSecond, I'm not as good a guy as Clark Kent ever was. I see that now; let me explain. There are seven human beings still alive on Earth; the rest of us were wiped out by aliens. They brought colony ships the size of the Moon, dozens of them; you can see the whole fleet at night. I can't imagine how many of them there are. Hundreds of billions? Trillions? \n\nTrillions of them against seven of us, and we're winning. One of us brought down a colony ship yesterday. Again, this thing was moon-sized and filled with billions of aliens. She took a running start and jumped from the Earth's surface hard enough to punch a hole out the back of the ship. The whole thing just shattered into scrap metal.\n\nI think we should surrender. I haven't said so out loud, not to any of you, but I still think it. Seven of us against trillions of them, and why are we fighting? I don't think it's for revenge, but it's something close. It isn't to save the world; we got these powers too late for that. Therein lies the problem. Nothing we do to these invaders will bring back the people they killled. Our actions from now on can only decide what happens to us and the aliens. I think a trillion lives are worth more than seven, no matter how we ended up in this situation. No matter who those lives are, human or otherwise. \n\nI dunno if you agree with that or not. I dunno which choice Superman would make. I can't even picture him thinking of a moral dilemma like this. To Superman, the right thing to do is instantly obvious. Me though; I have to think on it.\n\nSo I thought on it, and I realized something. Whatever the source of our powers is, whether you call it magic or mana or Light or a million other things; there is a source. It's something only humans can use. And we can be reasonably sure evolution just doesn't do this.\n\nI think there's a God. I never believed in Him before first contact, and for a while afterward I kinda figured the existence of aliens confirmed it. I read a book once that had this line about evolution. *There were only two known causes of purposeful complexity. Natural selection, which produced things like butterflies. And intelligent engineering, which produced things like cars.*\n\nThis magic, whatever it really is, it didn't evolve. It was created, and whatever entity has the resources to create a source of magic must, by definition, be a god. One that specifically took interest in humans for a number of possible reasons, including ones suggested by a few of our religions. And those religions usually also claim that God has *been* here, to Earth, and spoke in person with His creations. Wherever He is now, he hasn't been paying attention. \n\nOne inference leads to another. If magic, then God. If God, then Heaven. If Heaven, then afterlife and souls and *one possible chance* to undo the extinction of the human race and end the conflict with these aliens without murdering them all. God isn't paying attention though, so someone has to go find Him and tell Him to look this way.\n\nI'm leaving. I don't know what will happen to me if I fly too far from Earth or the Sun; maybe the magic will cut off and I'll need air again and I'll die out there in space. I don't even know where I'm going; which way God went; so I'm relying on faith and that sounds like a shitty plan, but I have to do it.\n\nI leave this note to you, the six of you, and I hope you forgive me. I hope you do what you can to spare the enemy's life, and I hope I come back one day to fix this. If not, this is my suicide note. There are worse ways to die. \n\nI have to do this. The chance to save seven billion lives, however slim, is worth the risk to my one life, however great. Now that I think about it, that does sound almost like what Superman might say.\n\nGoodbye."", ""Kevin listened to the Oracle while sitting on the cloth that covered the pile of rubble beneath it. He's heard the tale more times than he can count: on that fateful day, 25th December of the year 2017, fleets of starships darkened the sky, and leveled the human civilization. \n\nThe oracle spoke of times when humans were plenty, the time when people would gather in the weekends for drinks, the time when people fought amongst themselves over petty differences‚Ä¶ They're all gone now. The aliens wiped them all out. All those years of hard work, all the things they have learned over time, the monuments they managed to build were all erased when the fleet arrived, and, according to the Oracle, ‚Äúglassed the planet‚Äù. The oracle never spoke about how many were killed, perhaps even he doesn't know. He did however, spoke in detail as to the destruction of civilizations: How the tallest buildings erupted in flames, how the people simply turned to ash without even burning, how none managed to find out a way to deal with the aliens despite many of them spending thousands of hours practicing how to fight them‚Ä¶ \n\nThe next part always dreads Kevin. The oracle would move close to him, ignite the candles in the hut with a motion of his hand, and tell Kevin it is his destiny to overthrow the aliens, before telling him to put out the candles without leaving his seat. \n\nKevin sat as still as he can. This is going to be another failure, another time he would disappoint the Oracle and his people‚Ä¶ It's not like he doesn't have any idea on what the oracle wants him to do. Kevin knew the oracle meant for him to create a gust of wind with his mind, similar to how the Oracle lit the candles with his mind. \n\n‚ÄúOracle‚Ä¶‚Äù Kevin said while lowering his head in shame, ‚Äúyou know I can't do it, I've been trying since the first time I was here. There's just nothing I can do...‚Äù \n\nKevin remained in his seat, concentrating on creating a wind to put out all the candles. He had been doing this dance every week since he was ten. And now, five years later, he still hasn't been able to accomplish this simple feat. \n\nKevin continued to think of the wind, a strong breeze came through the door, blowing out all the candles. Just as Kevin was wondering whether this meant success for him, the Oracle signaled him to hide under the rug he was sitting on, before doing so himself. Kevin knew the alien patrols are nearby. Unlike putting out the candles, hiding from aliens is never something he had trouble with. Although he is having a tingly feeling, something is not right. \n\nAnd then he realized, none of them packed the candles. He pondered what he should do, as he heard the footsteps of three aliens jumping onto the ground. Each step they take, their greaves make a sound that warns everyone nearby of their presence. The message is clear -- be out of their sight, or be killed. \n\nThe footsteps growing ever closer. The aliens will search the area when they see the candles. Kevin thought of his next step. There are none. Had he been able to put out the candles earlier‚Ä¶ \n\nThe scream of the Oracle pulled Kevin back to reality. As he peeked from a hole in his cover, he saw one of the aliens, in his shiny silver armor, holding the Oracle in the air. The other two were stand next to him, crossing their arms, probably enjoying the sight of their comrade killing an old man. \n\nKevin thought of what he should do: continue to hide, and let the aliens take his mentor? Or would he try to fight them, and die. The Oracle would never wanted him to throw his life away for anyone, that he knows. He is important to overthrowing the aliens. But what good would he be if he didn't save the man that taught him everything. What good would he be if he died here...\n\nAnother scream. Kevin two pieces of debris, got out of his cover, and hurled them at the aliens. The aliens stood steadfast, letting their armor deflect the rocks. Kevin picked up another one, threw it at them again, nothing. Another one, and another‚Ä¶ \n\nUntil his arms grew tired and his couldn't pick up anymore rocks. The aliens looked at one another, as one of them produced a pistols from his holster, and began taking aim at Kevin‚Ä¶ \n\n*Why am I so useless* \n\nKevin thought to himself as he stared the alien in the eyes, prepared to die, he is useless anyway. \n\nThe alien squeezed the trigger, a blue bolt of energy launched at Kevin. He instinctively raised his hand at the bolt. Just as the bolt was about to hit him, he felt a warm wave of energy concentrate on his hand, flowing to his palm, and outward to the incoming projectile. \n\nThe bolt hit his hand, but it didn't hurt. And the feeling of warmth continued flowing through Kevin. \n\nKevin concentrated, looking at the aliens who are going to kill his friend. He let the energy wave concentrate on his hand again. Except this time the feeling is much more intense. He looked at the aliens one more time, and unleashed the wave of energy at them. He watched as his assailants come into contact with the wave of blue energy, and burned to ash in mere seconds. \n\nKevin rushes towards the Oracle and helped him get up. Together, they packed up their camp and headed home. "", 'Bruce stood against the wall, his whole body shaking with fear. Glaring at the creatures with hate filled eyes, he knew his end was near. The Wub had lined up 10 people along a wall execution style, ready to slauter and rid the earth of the human pest. Bruce had a welling feeling in his gut, could this be the powers the people were talking about? The Wub troopers aimed there weapons for the final part of the execution. Bruce couldn\'t hold it any longer, it was happening and he knew it. Gas filled the street with a toxic purple and yellow haze. The prisoners survived and had only one side effect, the putred smell of sulfer. Bruce looked at the back of his jeans. A giant hole on his butt. "" Dear God I\'m going to die from that smell, I\'m scared for life now"" spoke the young girl next to Bruce.

Piece by piece it was being ripped away in time with the rhythm of my heart. As soon as i felt that i could not go on something resonated with my mind. All of a sudden that burning was replaced with a tempered heat as if my soul itself was being reborn within those fires.  \n  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\nAs i laid there for the next couple minutes it felt as my body was rebooting itself, my senses slowly turning back on. The first thing i noticed was the smell of smoke all around me. Struggling at first, i pushed myself off the ground to try to find the source of the smell. Walking closer to my front door the smell increased in intensity as i neared. As I opened the door i felt a rush of hot air to meet me. Outside the embers of the world that i once knew danced upon the wind like the stars in the skies. The city i had grown up in was on fire, blazing like the gods themselves dropped hell fire upon the world. Suddenly there was a massive explosion and i felt a new way of heat as i was forced to close my eyes against the light. As i the light subsided i traced the sound to the rend that part of the city once occupied.  \n   \n  \n\nLooking up from the destruction my heart stop, on the horizon a colossus of a ship had teardrops falling on to the ground that the city once laid. Ice filled within my gut as i gazed upon the damage that the ship had brought. Dread gripping my heart i could only think of one thing, escape.\n  \n------------------------------\nAfter that night i began to question myself, what right do i have to live with all those that surely were lost within the eradication of the city. Why was i still alive while all those people were dead. After a few more days i began to hears whispers as the tempered heat came back to me filling me with someone. I did not know what was happening but those whispers started to cooing me into comfort. They whispered that what happened to those in the city was not my fault and that nothing i could\'ve done could\'ve changed what took place there. This soothed my worries some but i kept feeling i there was something that i had to do.\n  \n---------------------------------------\nA week later i was stopping at a river to drink, i do not know which one anymore as i had lost all form of direction due to my hunger which was a constant pain for me. After finishing i sat on the river bank staring into the water. This was becoming increasing common  lately. I do not know if it was the lack of food or the shock of destructed all those days ago but as i stared into those waters the whispers that had been my constant companion began to grow louder and louder. With there musings i began to lose myself in their words, drifting in and out of myself. As i regained myself i felt a cool blanket wrapped around myself. As if nature itself embraced me the sight around me breathtaking. Lilies sprouted around a red maple tree that wrapped around me as if to comfort me. The whispers did not silence as they once did before. Now they murmur in a chorus that clearly rang through me. The warmth that  always felt now began to bubble as they spoke. ""Through our sacrifice you preserve us."" With that the heat within me began to rapidly cool within me, hardening into steel. I knew what i must do in that moment. Without though i heard the words ""Retentat ligni vitae, e pluribus unum"" come to my mouth. With that i took off, back to the ruined city.', 'When it first showed up to our sensors, everyone thought it was just an interested asteroid. Sure, it was oblong, and one of the first we\'d ever observed, but it was hardly anything special. People speculated that it was an alien ship, but no one really believed it.\n\nThat is, until it spontaneously reversed it\'s trajectory. One day, it was headed out of the solar system faster than any man made craft. The next, it was hurtling towards Earth with unnatural precision. \n\nThe impact alone wiped out Canada and part of the USA. Debris clouded the atmosphere, and the world went dark. It was few month before it began to spread.\n\nIt wasn\'t just a space rock or a ship. It was *alive*. And it was hungry. It spread like rot, sucking the life out of everything it touched. Concrete disintegrated, steel corroded to dust, and flames did nothing. Wherever it went, it spewed noxious, toxic gas. Scientists recognized it as a terraforming device. We called it the Plague.\n\n People died in their homes, refusing to leave. People stuck in the traffic of evacuation found themselves trapped in a ring of the creeping rot. It seemed to seek out life, so that it could trap it and kill it. High altitude flight was impossible due to debris, and low altitude was incredibly dangerous, because the gas that permeated the atmosphere above the Plague was impossible to filter.\n\nThe human population steadily shrank, until the only free continent left was Australia. There were less than 10,000 of us when it happened. People began exhibiting strange power. Some could read minds. Others could teleport. Still others controlled the elements. I had the ability to fly. One thing that everyone had in common, however, was to share their energy with each other, from any distance, to boost one another\'s power.\n\nEventually, one man was found with the power to destroy the Plague. \n\nHis power was unique. It looked like raw energy, and it erased any Plague it came in contact with. He fired it from his hands as beams and blasts of blue or yellow light. Humanity immediately knew what they had to do.\n\nI was one of a team sent with him, comprised of myself, two other fliers, a wind mage to clear the air, a telepath to communicate remotely, and the man himself. Our mission was to fly to the source of the Plague to destroy it once and for all.\n\nThe flight was short. In less than a day, we reached the origin. It was the only feature in a smooth, shiny black wasteland.

Aliens meant fantastically futuristic, didn‚Äôt it?  They were supposed to have arrived in spaceships descending from orbit and raining death upon us with technological supremacy.  They might have landed their ships and been humanoids upon emerging from their crafts, wielding laser guns, or something similar, and decimating us with that technology.  Perhaps they would have been more beast like, like something from a Geiger painting‚Ä¶right; charging forth in a beast-like frenzy? \n\nFor all the world, back in early 2015‚Äîstill very much a technological age for well over 90 percent of the Earth‚Äôs inhabitants‚Äîthey had come sailing through the skies in what looked like ancient clippers, schooners, and similarly designed ships of wood.  Fantastic all right; as in what had resembled the dark peoples that might have made up Sauron‚Äôs army from The Lord of The Rings trilogy.  There were Orc-like creatures, and those with pointy ears and grey skin like evil Elves, and beserker men and women had come off those ships, washing forth upon our continents with sabres, swords, and bows, slaughtering those who‚Äôd gotten in the way.  Far worse were the Warlocks; men and women in flowing robes of varying black or red hues, depending on their bent for different schools of magic.  \n\nEven with the common soldiers, their armors‚Äîwe‚Äôd come to understand later‚Äîhad been gifted with runic magic, protecting them as they butchered any careless enough to not run away, who thought glocks and shotguns would save them.  Of course, governments around the world ordered jets and attack helicopters on those ships, though their machine guns and missiles exploded harmlessly against lavender colored energy shields.  When that didn‚Äôt work, larger missile strikes from military bases were tried‚Äîagain, having no effect on the spelled-ships.  It did take well over two years, but the Earth‚Äôs population had shrunk drastically with each passing month.  Of course, something strange had been realized by the dwindling population.  Magic of our own was still there, and much more present as 7 billion became 5 within the first year, and to what must be perhaps less than 1 billion now, though technology had all but ceased to function with destroyed satellites, power plants vaporized, and manufacturing plants amongst the first targets of the invaders.  We‚Äôre fighting back though, with our own magic, as best we can.  Our magic manifests differently though, from person to person.  While runes are woven with intricate hand gestures, and spells of power are worked when invoking the right words from our enemy, ours manifests quite differently.  \n_____________________________________________________\n\n[Part 2 coming right up, after THESE messages...]', 'You could feel static in the air.

The frequency of the shivers has kept increasing... I‚Äôm I think I‚Äôm starting to figure out why. \n\n A few days ago, my squad and I had retraced our steps while crossing the Alps, seeking refuge is a cave just a couple hundred feet down the western mountain side. A major blizzard heading toward us, there was going to be no way for us to push through to the Eastern War front in Austria without some of us freezing to death. Anyway, that night is when the Awakening happened. Half of us were asleep, the others on guard, waiting, watching for signs of extraterrestrial life; Zens to be more precise. They showed up only a couple of months ago and already an estimated 880 million people have died. I don‚Äôt know the true scientific name for them, but I do know they are a force to be reckoned with. Twice the size of the average human and five times as strong. Bullets can hurt them if you hit the right spot, but even then, they don‚Äôt go down easy. We just carry our rifles around to feel a bit safer.\n\n As the night shift took their posts, the rest of us took to our sleep, but not for long. After just 2 hrs of our bodies shocked us awake. I myself awoke to a small fire balls dancing around my finger-tips.\n\n ‚ÄúOh shit! Jesus, somebody help!‚Äù I shouted, flailing my hand around, trying to pat out the flames on my blanket, but it just burst into ashes.\n\n Nobody came, and for a moment, things went silent for me. I took a look around the room. Some of the watch and some of the sleepers, all reacting the same as I was. Stan was bent over, hold a hand full of icicles. Marks arm was sparking with electricity. Jack was trying to calm Stan down, but Jack‚Äôs body was filled with purple spots. Each spot was like looking at a flowing river of dark purple sludge. Richie was keeping his distance from the rest of us. It was in that moment that I looked down at my hand and realized the flames didn‚Äôt burn. After using common sense, I realized they weren‚Äôt even touching me. As soon as it became clear to me, the flames vanished. I turned my attention back to the group who had all realized the same thing. Everyone had calmed down, but we‚Äôre breathing heavily.\n\n ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù asked Mark.\n\n I looked at my hand once more, ‚ÄúI have no goddamned idea.‚Äù\n\n ‚ÄúThat was fucked up man!‚Äù Richie shouted, cowering in the back of the cave, ‚Äúyou guys stay the hell away from me!‚Äù\n\n ‚ÄúRichie nobody is gonna hurt you man, just take it easy all rig... Richie... your... shit...‚Äù Stan muttered, covering his mouth with one hand and brushing the other over his head.\n\n My head turned to Richie. A circular spot on his blue jacket was darker than the rest, and right in the middle, sticking out of his gut, was an icicle. \n\n Mark and Jack rushed to his side, throwing Richie‚Äôs weakened arms out of the way as he tried to block them. All I could do was stand there with Stan. We‚Äôd seen death before, some of our closest friends had succumbed to it, it wasn‚Äôt new to any of us. Mark and Jack could try anything they wanted, but that icicle was too big, and he was losing too much blood.\n\n Mark was the calm one, ‚ÄúHonestly Rich, it‚Äôs not that bad, it‚Äôs just a flesh wound,‚Äù he tried saying with a smile.\n\n ‚ÄúYou really think so Jack, it must feel worse than it looks then,‚Äù Richie said with a light chuckle.\n\n You could see it in his eyes, the light fading away. His body and mind going numb. He was accepting his fate... being killed by a friend.\n\n ‚ÄúRichie, stay with me man!‚Äù Jack yelled, putting pressure around the wound, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not dying on my you got that!‚Äù\n\n  ‚ÄúHa... this ain‚Äôt a move Mark... words can‚Äôt magically heal me... kill some Zens for me will ya?‚Äù Richie spoke his last words.\n\n Richie‚Äôs body went limp, his head dropping to the side. That was the first shiver. It was different than the normal shiver of death, it was more like a small shock running from my tailbone to my neck, like a shiver of life. I know everybody else felt it too. \n\n ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Stan muttered.\n\n The others all looked at me, ‚ÄúWe move on, and we kill some Zens,‚Äù I said, looking down at my hand, the flames reignited, a bit bigger than before.\n\nPart 2: Eastern Battle Front\nIf enough people want it.', 'At first, the aliens came in hordes. Wiped out everyone and everything they sensed a heart beat in. I lost my whole family within days, my father was the first to go protecting my older brother, then my mum protecting both of us. My brother and I were on the run for months until we got sloppy, stayed in the same place too long and he died protecting me. Somehow started a fire and took out 6 of those bastard aliens at once, made me proud to be related to him.  That was 2 years ago, I‚Äôve been alone ever since. \n.\nThe blood curdling screams of those found make it hard to sleep, the goosebumps that used to cover my skin everytime I heard that scream don‚Äôt appear anymore but the knowledge of what is happening to those screaming is a horror in its own. In an effort to drown out those screams I remind myself of the golden rule, move to a new spot every 3 days. When that doesn‚Äôt work I focus on my surroundings and close my eyes,I can almost see my surroundings identically in my head. I close my eyes and hope to get some rest for tonight, tomorrow is when I find a new spot.\n.\nI jolt upright, I swear I heard a noise. Everything in the room I slept in has moved around, somethings been here. I get up slowly, crouch low and move around the house. Searching each and every room, i feel different. As if I feel that the room is empty before turning into it. Through my travels I‚Äôve bumped into other people, traded items, bought weapons and been given food. I‚Äôve also heard stories of survivors manifesting powers, magic even. The ability to summon storms or move water, throw fire or read minds. After determining the house is safe I sit down and close my eyes. I picture the house in my mind and focus as hard as I can. A blueprint like imagine appears in my mind, turning and growing, a 3D image replica of the layout. I can see myself sitting next to the tv, my mind zooms into the room in in. This is some crazy shit, I wonder what else I can do. I picture the tv next to me exploding and I focus as hard as I can.\nBOOM.\n\n‚ÄúKid! Kid! Wake up!‚Äù\nStruggling, I wake up but keep my eyes closed. Fuck that was dumb, blowing up the tv right next to myself yeah, nice one idiot.\n‚ÄúOh thank god he‚Äôs awake, he blew up a tv next to himself‚Äù I can see the young girl sitting next to me, another man pacing in the corner of the room and another, older female sitting down in a chair. I try to open my eyes and the searing pain becomes obvious in my left eye. \n‚ÄúGlass cut your eye pretty deep, hit the cornea and maybe sliced some nerves. I was only a nursing student so I‚Äôm not too sure‚Äù the girl says apologetically, I look at her with my right eye and ask her how she knew I blew the tv up, her mother tells me her daughter was a mute her whole life but a couple of months ago she talked for the first time, but it wasn‚Äôt with her mouth. It was with her mind. She‚Äôs telepathic. They tell me they‚Äôve heard of a colony of people that are gaining powers in the north and that they are heading there, I‚Äôm welcome to go with them....\n\nPart 2 if anyone wants it available ', '""Nobody knows exactly how long they\'ve been here. By the time they revealed themselves on that fateful day, it was too late. They had infiltrated every facet of our lives, from our neighbourhoods to our government.\n\nShapeshifters. \n\nThey had been our friends, our co-workers, our in-laws. A small colony had landed originally, but their numbers had increased exponentially. We were outnumbered. We were outfought. We were almost completely eradicated.\n\nUntil the awakening.\n\nAs children growing up in the Western world, we had heard stories of magic, of witches and wizards. Arthurian legends of Merlin. In the East, tales of Genii were abound. Dismissed as folklore for generations, we had assumed it was all fairy tales, a way for our ancestors to explain what they did not understand. How wrong we were.\n\nThere is speculation as to why magic has returned, but nobody really understands. One theory I hear the men discuss is that as the number of humans decreased, their power increased. I saw a film along that premise once. I wonder if I\'ll ever get to see another film, read another book. I wonder if I\'ll ever be able to relax again at all. Some think that magic returning is God\'s way of saving humanity. I\'m not buying that. I can\'t believe in a higher power after what I\'ve seen. Where was their fucking God when the aliens first landed? When their numbers grew? WHEN THEY BUTCHERED OUR FAMILIES IN OUR OWN HOMES?? Fuck God. We are the gods now.\n\nOur resistance is small, but it is not the only one. We like it that way. No outsiders. We had been unable to fight them at first. Against their natural, bug-like form, our bullets are useless. In their human form they could be shot, but they acted just like us, *looked* just like us. You could never tell who was one of them, at least not until the power returned. It gave our eyes a reddish glow, marked us from them. Their alien eyes hadn\'t been able to pick up on it, and we had taken advantage. We butchered thousands of them before they realised we could tell them apart. It wasn\'t enough. It\'s never enough.\n\nSome of us have learnt to harness our power, our magic. We can fight the bugs in their natural form, which is how they spend all of their time now. We can break through their carapaces. We can call in the elements at will, rain down fire and brimstone on them. WE CAN BURN THESE UGLY MOTHERFUCKERS FROM THE INSIDE USING ONLY THE POWER OF THOUGHT!\n\nBut they are many, and we are few. And so the battle rages on. I am sending this message out, in the hope that anyone is still listening. In the hope that anyone is still out there at all. \n\nLet us not go down without a fight. They may have us on the back foot for now, but the human race is stronger than you or I ever thought possible! Harness your power! TAKE AS MANY OF THESE ALIEN SONS OF BITCHES DOWN WITH YOU AS YOU CAN!""\n\n*End Transmission*\n', '[Part 2]\n\nJoe Takada hadn‚Äôt been much of a man, not really; he‚Äôd been a 120 pounds soaking wet, had glasses, and his brain was the only muscle he‚Äôd really developed over his 19 years of life.  He liked more intellectual pursuits, and that was all that had mattered to him, before the invaders had come.  One his favorite passions had been anime; he almost could not have gotten enough of it.  With few friends, and little to no love life to speak of, the intricate stories and fluidity of those anime stories had been more of a friend than most people had been.  Dragonball Z, Bleach, Naruto; he would much more like to befriend Goku or Ichigo rather than the real people around him.  That‚Äôd been in 2015, of course.  He would have guessed it was close to the end of 2017 now, and his life was much different.  Actually, in a way, he‚Äôd like to think himself as something like Trunks though, harkening back to Dragonball Z.  He wasn‚Äôt in the future, but the present was desolate now, with more buildings hulking piles of rubble than whole now‚Äîto Joe it seemed as a mirror to the future Trunks had come from.  He‚Äôd even taken to wearing a sword on his back, and wearing a purple jacket, much like his favorite character from that anime.  After all, he was very much like a character from the pages of Toriyama‚Äôs magna.\n\nJoe was powerful now, though not of muscle really, though swordplay had been developing his upper body more than he might have thought.  Lots of cardio too; you needed that, when marauding hordes of Orcs, Elves, and humans from another world were out to kill you and everyone else on this planet.  There were fighters though, some were wielding magic much like their enemy, some had become something like super heroes, and had even taken to wearing costumes like the tales told through comic books that people had once read and watched in the movie theaters.  \n\nHe‚Äôd almost drifted off to sleep, when the shifting of rubble from what must have been seventy or eighty feet down the hall had sent adrenaline surging through him, instantly rousing him into wakefulness and with a heightened sense of alertness.  Uhl‚ÄôThreka‚Äôs band had finally found him.  I would have liked to meet them tomorrow morning, but it seems like they can‚Äôt wait for their death any longer. \n\nReaching down to the leylines of magic that had crisscrossed the Earth, Joe had drawn upon it until power surged through him.  The only way he could think to describe it was a system more akin to the stories of Naruto.  Chakra and chakra gates must have been a real thing, as the magic within him seemed to have manifested in this way.  His legs and arms were stronger, and he‚Äôd been practicing martial arts, as best he could‚Äîhe could throw punches and kicks far faster and more powerfully than should have been possible.  It was a clumsy system, or style he supposed he should say, developed only through books pilfered from now defunct or destroyed libraries.   Masking his power would have been useless, Uhl‚ÄôThreka was one of the more powerful Warlocks in Oregon; he‚Äôd be able to detect the life force of one of the myriad number of rats scuttling through the building, so of course he‚Äôd be able to sense even a disguised power such as Joe might be able to make himself appear to be. \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come out now, Takada-san, so we can have a chat, yes?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúActually General Threka, I was going to ask you if you‚Äôd care to step outside?‚Äù\n\nJoe didn‚Äôt let the Warlock make the mock choice though, as he flashed through a tear in the wall of his makeshift room of the week, and out into the night.  Though he could see quite well in the dark, a few fires raged in buildings around him, casting a feint red and yellow glow, as well as a nearly full moon casting its own light.  So there‚Äôd been plenty of illumination to see Uhl‚ÄôThreka and his minions, as they came outside moments later.  Two towering Kordens, the Orc-like creatures that were the true muscle of the invaders armies, stood near to eight feet tall, wicked curved swords in hand as something like smiles played about their brown, brutish faces resembling pigs more than men.  Threka even had some magic underlings as well, as three Luden women trailed behind the Warlock, their thin hands already weaving runes about the lumbering beasts.  Uhl‚ÄôThreka himself was slight in stature, though the Warlocks‚Äô magical might was the intimidating factor about the Luden man in a robe of dark scarlet.  Even with runeic might playing about them, Joe was concerned little about the Kordens.  A moment later, he let Uhl Threka know why. \n\nJoe pushed himself nearly to the limits of his power, and performed flashing leaps, hopping on the chest of the first Korden in less than a blink of an eye, and slashing through its neck in another two or three milliseconds, the head falling to the ground in what seemed as such a slow speed as to be nearly perceived as not moving at all.  Joe‚Äôs sword flashed again as he vaulted off the now dead Korden, and plunged his blade deep into the brain of the other, making a few dozen slices through it just to be sure.  A bolt of purple energy almost touched Joe as he flashed back to almost exactly where he‚Äôd been standing before killing Threka‚Äôs bodyguards, but it wasn‚Äôt quick enough.  What must have been a dozen more magic bolts might have killed Joe, if he‚Äôd been as weak as Uhl‚ÄôThreka must have thought him to be.  In a blur of motion, he deflected the magic away as if they were mosquitos of light that might have been trying to feast on his blood, deflected away and sent careening into the night.  \n\n‚ÄúListen Warlock, you know your lackeys can do nothing to me, and I see that your Korden are just about useless to you now, so let‚Äôs make this about you and me already.‚Äù\n\nUhl‚ÄôThreka guffawed loudly at the thought, and Joe let the moment of imagined supremacy be the undoing of the Warlock‚Äôs flunkies.  He brought a large amount of power into his hands, and threw out green energy beams at Threka‚Äôs female mages, felling them in quick, precise strikes.  He‚Äôd thrown a few more out at Threka himself, in what Joe had hoped would be quick enough, though the Warlock seemed to become as a ghost for a moment, the beams passing harmlessly through him and into the night, destroying parts of a building behind the Luden man with loud crashes of energy meeting stone.  The Warlock manifested himself a moment later in the same place with a wicked smile.  \n\n‚ÄúYou underestimate my mastery Takada-san, how unfortunate for you.  You‚Äôve been quite a bothersome insect, more a wasp than the worm I once thought you to be, to your credit.  Wasps can be exterminated almost as easily though, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre more aware than I, being a true denizen of this world.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou know Threka, there are species of insects that can kill a man?  Yes, there are ants and wasps, and other insects, that are so poisonous tha,‚Äù Joe hoped the talking would be enough of a distraction, as he launched an attack at the Warlock.  He‚Äôd flashed behind the Luden, only to be knocked aside by a massive flaring of purple-red power.  Slamming into a broken down diesel truck, Joe might have slumped to the ground, had the Warlock not materialized in the spot where Joe would have fallen, and clutched at Joe‚Äôs throat. \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre buzzing and stinging ends here Takada-san.  Know that now, even as your life ebbs from you, that I respect you.  Until the very end, that‚Äôs what the san at the end of your name means in the culture of your homeland, yes‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nA red gloved-hand erupted through Uhl‚ÄôThreka‚Äôs head then, and as Joe hit the ground, panting and gasping for air, he looked up to his savoir, and a smile bloomed across his face. Why hadn‚Äôt he reached out to her earlier?  \n\n‚ÄúWell Joe Takada, looks like I‚Äôve forced the argument upon you, haven‚Äôt I?‚Äù\n\nLinda Johnson, though she referred to herself as Lady Red now, smiled down at him as he still massaged his neck.  Joe realized then that she‚Äôd been right all along, that there was strength in numbers, that it would take everyone with power to have even a chance of sending the invaders back to wherever they came from. \n\n‚ÄúYes, ‚Äú his voice still pinched a little from lack of air,‚Äù I suppose your right.  I suppose it‚Äôs time you take me to the Revolt.  Let me gather my things, and w-well‚Ä¶thank you; thank you very much.‚Äù\n', 'Emily sat across from him at a table draped with a red satin tablecloth.  Her champagne flute remained untouched as she searched for the words to say.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Jacob, but,‚Äù she paused averting her gaze.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for a long term relationship.  It‚Äôs just too much right now.  You‚Äôre great, truly.  But I think it‚Äôs best if we take a break.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù he asked, sadness crept into his voice.\n\nShe sighed quietly.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said rising from the table leaving him alone, head hanging.\n\nHe watched her go, her heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant.  *Well, this version didn‚Äôt work either.  Maybe she really wasn‚Äôt ready for a long term relationship,* he wondered.\n\n*Or. Maybe she doesn‚Äôt realize just how much she needs me.* He dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night.  Heavy rain drops began to fall as he made his way toward Emily‚Äôs apartment. \n \nEmily tossed herself down onto her couch and pulled her plush robe around herself.  She clutched the warm cup of tea between her hands and drank deeply.  \n\n*This is what I want,* she smiled.\n\nA quiet scratching turned her head.  *Probably the storm.* She turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped.\n\nThe scratching came again, more urgently this time.  She set her tea down, her bare feet whispered across the floor as she made her way to the front door.  She had to stand on her toes to see through the small peephole.  \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm just hearing things,‚Äù she tried to convince herself.  \n\nAnother series of frantic scratching turned her head toward the window.  She grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat.  Lightning flashed outside her apartment, the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on her fire escape.  \n\n*Is that?*\n\nA quiet meow came from the window as a reply to her question.\n\n‚ÄúYou poor thing!‚Äù she cooed as she opened the window and lifted the soaking wet kitten inside.  The cat meowed happily and pressed its head against her plush robe.\n\nEmily dried him off and got a small dish of tuna fish for the cat.  It didn‚Äôt have a collar or anything that could help her identify who the cat could possibly belong to.\n\n‚ÄúWell, I need to call you something. Any ideas?‚Äù\n\n*Jacob,* the cat thought to himself and meowed again.\n\n‚ÄúHow about Hamlet?‚Äù\n\nJacob meowed again. *Doesn‚Äôt matter to me as long as you love me.*  \n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!

""Let me guess,"" he continued, releasing his grip and pulling a chair out from the table. ""Sit, please. Let me guess, you\'re a Mari- no, no, you\'re a Cassandra? I\'m right, am I not?"" \n\n*Suave.* Yes, that was what he would be today.\n\nThe woman\'s botoxed forehead tried its best to frown, her lips fighting (and losing) a similarly uneven battle. ""How on Earth did you know that?"" \n\nRaul slicked his dark hair back with ringed fingers. ""Your beauty, it was that of a Maria, or a Cassandra, and there was a certain radiance that could be of no Maria. I see, no wrinkle has dared to blight your perfect face -- that tells me all I need to know."" He lowered his voice to a rippling whisper. ""*All I need to know.*""\n\nCassandra giggled through perfectly still lips as she slid into a seat. ""My,"" she said, ""You are a charmer. And that accent... Australian?""\n\n""Australian?""\n\n""Yes. I\'m certain of it. I\'ve got an aunt who lives there, and strike me down if you don\'t sound *just the same!* Don\'t worry -- she\'s a smoker.""\n\nRaul cursed himself silently. He hadn\'t done enough research for the role. No, it was fine -- he\'d improvise. \n\n""Yes, mate. Good catch.""\n\nHe sat in his seat and raised a hand, clicking his fingers to gain the attention of a waiter. ""If I had a bloody boomerang, I\'d get us the wine myself,"" he said with a wink.\n\nAnother half chuckle as the waiter approached. Raul knew her very favourite drink, her very favourite food... Yes, this time he\'d get the pudding he\'d been after for so long. But he had to be confident. She liked confident.\n\n""Lambrusco, for the lovely Sheila. And the house re- a uh...""--he swallowed hard--""Fosters for me."" \n\nThe waiter lifted his head and eyed Raul snobbishily. ""*House Fosters*, sir?""\n\n""Yeah,"" Raul replied, tugging at his shirt. ""You know, out of the house tap.""\n\n""Very good, sir. And to eat?""\n\n""Pie and chips for the lady, and... do you do anything off the barbie?""\n\n""Sir?""\n\n""Struth. Just a burger then, mate.""\n\nThe lady eyed Raul with suspicion. ""I wouldn\'t normally let someone order for me, but... How did you know I loved pies?""\n\n""Know? Oh, that you\'re a classy pie lass? Well, it\'s obvious ain\'t it.""\n\n""Is it?""\n\n""It is to me. A lady who would wear a fashionable tracksuit like that, to a place like this, well, she\'d be after the fanciest meal on the whole bloody menu.""\n\nIf she could have smiled she would have done, Raul hoped. God, she was beautiful. Beneath all that make up. Maybe. Raul began to sweat. This was the best any of their dates had gone *to date*. He couldn\'t mess it up now. It was time to lay his heart on the table.\n\n""Look, Cassandra, I\'m gonna\' level with you. I think you\'re mighty fine, and I reckon you think I\'m fine. I mean, I figure I\'m the sort of guy you\'d normally go for.""\n\nCassandara shrugged. ""Eh.""\n\n""Eh? What do you mean, \'eh\'""?\n\n""You\'re a little too pretty-boy, for my tastes, to be honest.""\n\n""You can\'t be serious. You can\'t be bloody serious! I\'ve seen all the men you\'ve rejected. What the hell is left?""\n\nCassandra went tense. ""You\'ve *seen* the men I\'ve been out with?""\n\n""Well I er, oh struth,"" Raul said sadly, knowing he couldn\'t stop it now. The man\'s stylish exterior began to wilt, his skin flaking to reveal the green monstrosity beneath. Screams echoed about the restaurant and cutlery migrated high in all directions.\n\n""Wh-what kind of monster are you?"" asked Cassandra, her lips trying desperately to quiver.\n\n""Me?"" Raul asked, a rage in the pit of his stomach rising. ""Me?! What the hell kind of monster are *you*? -- That\'s the real question! I\'ve tried *everything* to please you. I\'ve been Brad bloody Pitt and Oscar bloomin Wilde. Nothing makes you happy. Nothing!"" He realised at this point that he didn\'t *need* to keep the accent up, but there was something rather bloody pleasing about it.\n\n""Th-hey were *you*?""\n\nRaul\'s skin began to change again, his black hair falling out in thick clumps, while greasy blonde hair sprouted hurriedly in its place. It took only seconds for Cassandra to be face to face with... Cassandra.\n\n""This,"" said the new Cassandra, as it got up from its seat, ""Is the only person I think you could ever love. You are the worst specimen of any creature I\'ve ever met. And I\'ve been to the Betelgeuse system *and* Scotland. Good day to you!""\n\nRaul/Cassandra had almost stomped its way to the door, when it heard the plaintive scream from behind and stopped in its tracks.\n\n""Waiiit!""\n\nThe other Cassandra came running up to it. \n\n""What do you want now? Come to mock me one last time?""\n\n""Mock? No! I\'d never mock someone like you. Mmm mm mmmm, you are *gorgeous*. I think... I think I was a bit hasty. How about one more try?"" she asked with a salacious wink.\n\nRaul/Cassandra  smiled. *Finally*.\n\n""Can you change *any* part of your body?"" she inquired as they walked back towards their table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Nate had sort of backed himself into a corner. Having been on as many dates with Amaya as he had, the walls were closing in on him. He had to pretend not to know all her answers to common first date questions (2 siblings, parents divorced when she was little, works in accounting), and if he ever misstepped, the game was up. It was a high-wire act that no one was aware of but him.\n\nBut that\'s what made it fun.\n\nHe was fine with the double life he\'d have to lead if it worked, that was nothing new to him. Nate was all things to all people, and it made the minutiae of life constantly entertaining. He realized Amaya had been talking for a few minutes and he hadn\'t been paying attention to any of it. Now she was looking at him expectantly.\n\nHe took a shot in the dark. ""I work in finance,"" he said. That wasn\'t a lie, he was actually a financial planner. She nodded amicably. Nate let out an internal sigh of relief, he\'d nailed it.\n\n""Do you come here often?"" Amaya asked.\n\n""Yeah, I love Spider House,"" Nate replied.\n\n""Weird, I\'ve never seen you here. This is, like, my favorite place in the world."" Nate tried not to let a smile sneak out. He always found these kinds of situations really amusing; if he just got out with it, he could turn worlds upside down. He never did, though.\n\n""Yeah, it\'s because I\'m a shapeshifter,"" he said through a cheeky grin. Amaya laughed. Nate laughed.', '""Hey, are you okay?""\n\nMaria wiped the tears from her cheeks. She sniffled, looking anywhere but the man standing next to her. She\'d gone to the pier to be alone not have random strangers approach her.\n\n""I-I\'m fine,"" Maria looked out toward the ocean, watching as the whitecaps broke and wove over each other, and how the seagulls and birds flew through the stormy grey sky.\n\nThe man leaned against the railing of the pier next to her. ""Well, I hope you don\'t mind me saying, but you look like your dog just died.""\n\nMaria sniffed again, her lips curling downward as she gripped the leash in her pocket.\n\n""I-I did.""\n\nThere was a pause and the man sighed. ""Shit, I\'m really sorry. I didn\'t mean-""\n\n""No, no, it\'s okay,"" Maria said. ""This was... this was Max\'s favorite place to go for our walks. He, um, he was a weird dog, but I loved him. I\'ve had him for so long.""\n\nA handkerchief appeared on the railing and Maria wiped her tear stained cheeks. ""Thank you."" \n\n""Sounds like a hell of a dog."" The man mused.\n\n""He was,"" Maria nodded. ""He always protected me, heck, he even slept in my bed. He did *not* like my boyfriends."" She smiled.\n\n""Sounds like a good boy. Dog\'s can sense that, you know? If a person is good enough for their person.""\n\nMaria laughed at that. ""Well, he also ate my Italian heels and destroyed two couches, so he had his ups and downs.""\n\nThe man snorted. ""Sounds like an ass.""\n\n""He was a good boy,"" Maria mused. She cleared her throat and offered the man back his handkerchief. ""Thank you.""\n\n""No problem,"" the man turned finally and smiled as he took it from her.\n\nMaria paused, her eyes roving over the tanned face and black hair, and the mans eyes. ""You have his eyes.""\n\nThe man blinked. ""I\'m sorry?""\n\n""He was a husky mix, he had mismatched eyes.""\n\nThe man slowly blinked again before he shrugged, an amused smile on his face. ""I\'ve had a lot of people comment on my eyes, but never that I looked like a dog.""\n\nMaria gasped. ""O-Oh, no, I didn\'t-""\n\nThe man laughed. ""Hey, it\'s okay."" He offered her his hand. ""What\'s your name?""\n\n""Maria,"" she blushed as she shook his hand. ""What\'s yours?""\n\n""Maximillion, but Max for short."" he winked, then spoke in a lower whisper. ""My parents were weird. They named the dog Ted.""\n\nMaria laughed at that. She flushed when she realized Max had watched her, a warm smile on his face. \n\n""Hey, I\'ve heard there\'s supposed to be a coffee shop near here... do you want to go? I\'d love to hear more about your Max."" \n\nMaria nodded. She gave the ocean one last glance before she pulled out the leash from her pocket. Max covered it with his hand, taking her hand with his. \n\n""Come on, let\'s get out of the rain.""\n\nMaria nodded.', 'Jess could pinpoint exactly when she first thought her feelings were wrong: eighth grade after Advanced Algebra. Her friend Katie got an 82% on a test‚Äî and that was disastrously low for Katie‚Äôs norm, and considered even lower by her parents standards.  Jess spent the rest of the class period trying to cheer her friend up:\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one test‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt define you. You‚Äôre amazing and good at everything. You‚Äôre kind and pretty, and this is just a small hiccup! I know you‚Äôll ace the next test! I know it! We can study together‚Äî and you‚Äôll probably be saving me from failing, like you normally do.‚Äù\n\nWhen Katie smiled back at her, with a red nose, and puffy eyes, Jess knew that she felt something more for her friend.\n\nJess, of course, buried her feelings. By no means was she homophobic, but every time she began to feel something for a friend or looked too long at a woman that walked by, she felt unsure of herself, felt like others would somehow know what she was thinking and judge her. So she buried it down‚Äî at least, until college.\n\nJess decided that she would at least try to get into the dating world. She‚Äôd go to parties with her friends, and when guys would be interested in her, she‚Äôd flirt back and have some fun‚Äî and she did, in fact, enjoy her time with most of these guys. So she continued to have fun at parties, flirt, have some friends with benefits, but nothing substantial. Jess liked these guys, of course, but nothing felt like the dramatic and raw feeling of love and emotion that she always heard about from her friends. She decided it was time to start seriously dating‚Äî time to find Mr Right, and then she would start to understand how all her friends felt with their boyfriends. They even said it themselves, ‚ÄúYou just haven‚Äôt found the right guy, Jess.‚Äù\n\nThe first few relationships Jess was in did not last long‚Äî barely even a relationships since they were only a handful of dates and kisses over two or three months before parting ways.\n\nThen she met Matt. He was gorgeous‚Äî all of Jess‚Äôs friends said so‚Äî and he was very into her. \n\n‚ÄúJess, I haven‚Äôt been completely honest,‚Äù he said one night during a dinner date two months into their relationship.\n\n‚ÄúUm‚Äî what?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe first time I met you, it wasn‚Äôt at that coffee shop. We were actually at the same college‚Äî we had a lecture together for one semester. I saw you at a couple parties too.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Jess said, relieved to find out she wasn‚Äôt a side-chick or that his secret wasn‚Äôt relationship-ending‚Äî but she realized that, maybe she didn‚Äôt really care if their relationship ended anyway. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Äî okay. I don‚Äôt remember seeing you though.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI realized that at the shop,‚Äù he said smiling a bit sheepishly, ‚Äúbut we didn‚Äôt really talk and I looked a bit different back then.‚Äù\n\nJess broke up with Matt three months later. \n\n‚ÄúHow could you break up with him? He was so hot!‚Äù Regina, her roommate and best friend since college, told her.\n\n‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt any spark‚Äî he was kind of a doormat. He had no personality and went with whatever I said.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat sounds like the perfect man to me.‚Äù Jess threw the couch pillow at her. ‚ÄúOkay, okay‚Äî no man slaves. Hey‚Äî wanna watch a movie tonight?‚Äù\n\nAnd Jess never felt more comfortable, more at home, than sharing a blanket with Regina on their couch and watching a crappy movie.\n\nRegina moved out six months later to live with her boyfriend.\n\n‚ÄúAre you bringing Cam to the engagement party?‚Äù Regina asked her half a year later. ‚ÄúMost people Jim and I invited are bring their boyfriends or girlfriends.‚Äù\n\nJess had been dating Cameron for five months now, and things were nice. They liked all of the exact same things, worked in similar fields, had the same hobbies‚Äî everyone said they were perfect for each other.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, he said he‚Äôll come. You said to come for dinner at eight? Is there anything I could bring? Dessert? Wine?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou know we always appreciate more wine‚Äî but we‚Äôve got plenty already. All you have to do is bring yourself. And Cam.‚Äù\n\nJust a few weeks after Regina‚Äôs wedding eight months later, Jess broke it off with Cam. The wedding itself was beautiful, and Jess couldn‚Äôt bear to make Regina worry by breaking up with Cam before it.\n\n‚ÄúBut Jess‚Äî I love you‚Äî we love each other! We love all the same foods and places. We even listen to the same music and watch the same shows‚Äî we were perfect for each other this time!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing, Cam, I don‚Äôt want someone who‚Äôs the same as me. I don‚Äôt want to date myself. I want to date someone that‚Äôs different and will push my boundaries‚Äî make me try new things‚Äî maybe I‚Äôll find things that I never even knew I liked before‚Äî‚Äú \n\nShe thought of all the men she‚Äôs dated in the past: they were all the same. They were all Nice Guys that were nice and sweet but had nothing to them‚Äî each relationship was hollow and lacked any true, real substance. How many men had she gone on dates with? 15? 20? And none of them made her feel any different. She longed to feel the feelings she felt for her friends with anyone who wasn‚Äôt her friends. Maybe, she thought, maybe she could. She was so tired, she had nothing to lose.\n\n‚ÄúCam, we‚Äôre through. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs sudden, but I‚Äôm tired‚Äî of everything‚Äî I have been for a while now, even before I met you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell... I hope you meet someone one day,‚Äù Cam said after a long moment. ‚ÄúMaybe whoever you date next will be the right man for you.‚Äù\n\nJess remained quiet as Cam packed up the few things he had in her apartment. She doubted any man would be right for her.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\nIt took her two weeks to text Regina and ask her to meet her for drinks on Friday night.\n\n‚ÄúHey, Jess‚Äî isn‚Äôt this a gay bar that we‚Äôre going to? I heard it‚Äôs a lot of fun,‚Äù she said while they were walking.\n\n‚ÄúYeah‚Äî I wanted to check it out,‚Äù Jess said. They walked in silence for a minute before Jess‚Äô nerves got to her. ‚ÄúOk‚Äî wait, stop walking for a sec. I‚Äî I need to tell you. We‚Äôre not going to this bar just for fun‚Äî I think I‚Äôm bi‚Äî or a lesbian. I don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh‚Äî okay,‚Äù Regina said after a moment. ‚ÄúHow long do you think you‚Äôve known?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEighth grade. I told you about Katie from high school right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh . Yeah that makes sense,‚Äù Regina thought for a moment. ‚ÄúOk you ready to start walking again? It‚Äôs cold.‚Äù\n\nJess couldn‚Äôt be happier, and hanging out at a bar with her best friend, and the flutters in her stomach when other women came up to them to flirt‚Äî it was one of the best nights she‚Äôs had in a long time. \n\nAnd that same bar is where she met Taylor three weeks later. There was something about her‚Äî something that made Jess feel like they knew each other for a long time. They liked a lot of the same things, but were different enough that things were still interesting. \n\nThere were some things that were a bit quirky though. Taylor was really bad at shaving her legs‚Äî she would always nick them multiple times every time she shaved. She was also really bad with makeup and couldn‚Äôt tell concealer from foundation. She never had any pads or tampons in her apartment either. Jess had never asked her about it, but she hoped nothing traumatic happened to Taylor that would cause her period to stop. Taylor also had a whole ton of men‚Äôs clothing in her apartment.\n\nFor all her quirks though, Jess felt better with Taylor than she had with any of the men in her past. ', ""You thought I couldn't tell, but I could. You can change your face, but not your inability to get your face shaved consistently, or the dumpy clothes you always pick, despite seemingly having any body you want.\n\nYou can change your dick size, but it doesn't matter because you never get me home anyway. You can't change your shitty taste in books, or music, or the shows you watch, or the way you talk about them, the way you believe the things you consume are the person you are.\n\nYou think you can change yourself on the outside and that it will change the way I feel inside, but it never will, because you still can't escape the essential you-ness of you; in fact, it probably prevents you from being able to make those most essential changes. After all, you can be anyone, right? But the problem is, you've only ever understood people for who they appear to be on the outside, and this failure of imagination has lead you to believe that you only are the person you are on the outside.\n\nYou thought I couldn't tell, but I could. The next time I smell dollar-store ramen on the breath of a poorly-dressed Brad Pittish guy who just so happens to share all of my tastes, who knows just the movie to recommend, just the perfect little spot we should try for dinner, I will simply knife him, knife you. And you will die, and transform into the pitiable, shapeless mass your kind always are at heart. And everyone will understand immediately what I've done, and why I've done it, and I will walk out into the sunlight, and feel it on my skin, the way I feel it on my skin every time, the way I can only feel it on my skin, because it's the only skin I've got or will ever have. A feeling you cannot ever know.\n\nI'm serious about stabbing you though."", ""There was something about her stare that caught me. It wasn't the green of her irises nor the deep black of her neverending lashes. It was the curvature underneath her eyes every time she smiled, and the glint in her pupils shining like a shooting star in a cold winter night.\n\nI had never witnessed beauty in such purity, not even in my best shapes. See, she had inner beauty. Every gesture of her was a mirror of the warmth in her soul, of its kindness. Something no shapeshifter can't imitate.\n\nI wanted her. And I wouldn't give up no matter the rejections or the many shatters in my heart. Nothing mattered but her. \n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThree years it took me to understand her taste. She liked them shy and handsome, pensive and profound. I remember the day I conquered her for the first time, the nerves I felt crawling across my chest, the shape I took. Everything.\n\nBut it didn't work out. She freaked out when she saw... well let's not talk about what I hide in my basement, it's not there anymore or I should say *they* are not there anymore. We shapeshifters can be quite disgusting to the unknowledgeable.\n\nThe second time was much easier yet the nerves were still there, blooming like a rose in late spring. I got her to dine with me in a fancy restaurant. She wore a dress of intense red, it sculpted her figure tightly... what a masterpiece she was. I, of course, wore another suit: a short man with a chiseled jaw. I pretended to be an engineer but the lie merely got so far. Let's just say that before the desserts, the only thing of intense red in our table was my face with her hand plastered on it.\n\nGoddamned rings. They hurt.\n\nNow, I managed to get a third date. I didn't shapeshift this time, my basement is empty and there are no lies in the table. But there's is a gun in my kitchen. I can't deal with the grief of losing her, I thought I could but I cant.\n\nI knew the risks of a woman like this and I accepted them with no complains. But there's a truth I refused to believe. It was clear from the beginning, bright as the sun... as her eyes.\n\nShe's pure of soul and I'm rotten inside.\n\nWe were never supposed to be.  "", 'New town. Small and quiet, perfect for my situation.\n\nThe authorities are after me. They know what I am : different, a national threat. They‚Äôre aware of what I‚Äôve done. If they catch me it‚Äôll be prison or death, the fate of countless others like me.\n\nStray dogs and playing children in the streets. Nervously, avoiding eye contact with the receptionist, I book a room at a guesthouse and try to sleep for a couple of hours but to no avail. I get up shower, put on some jeans. Head to the local bar to wind off.\n\nClouds of smoke, full of loud men. Standing at the threshold, I‚Äôm about to leave without getting a drink when she comes up behind me.\n\n‚ÄúExcuse me, are you getting in?‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nPerfect hair, perfect nose. She smiles uneasily on the first date, eyes darting stealthily towards the door of the French restaurant. On the second date, I channel a German tourist and she is bored by my stories of Berlin nightclubs and beer festivals. On the third - me as a lumberjack from a  neighboring town - this time she seems interested, eyes sliding across my bulging forearms and she even gives me a peck on the cheek but she doesn‚Äôt reply my message the next day. On the fourth, she asks me to walk her home, and I‚Äôm surprised because I, stammering and clumsy, had taken the form of  a skinny bespectacled bookkeeper, a complete loser, but her interest was at an all time high, giggling and all that, hand resting on my reedy wrist. \n\nShe invites me inside. Small and clean place, curtains drawn tight. I sit on an armchair and try to calm my excitement: it‚Äôs a perfect time to show this beautiful woman the truth, before things got too heated, when she was least expecting it. Like so many others before her. \n\nI want her to see the real me. As she busies herself in the kitchen, it takes a second to take my true form: tall and gangly, scarred face: the legacies of many a manicured victim.\n\nI take out the little pocket knife and, approaching the kitchen where she is humming, hide it behind my back.\n\n', 'I try to do it differently each time; short with long hair, tall with a buzz-cut, black, white, Asian, Pacific Islander, optimism, nihilism. Not in any particular order, but never randomly either; I know what she likes. I\'ve had a long time to figure her out- years and years.\n\nWhen I first arrived in this city, a lonesome, weary traveller, I only hoped to find a home or, at the very least, some semblance of one. The thought of companionship hadn\'t crossed my mind in ages. When you have lived for as long as I have, after all the trials and failures I\'ve  endured, it was difficult to maintain motivation. \nI was jaded and I was painfully aware of it. I had fallen into thinking that that would be my eternal, repetitious existence- but when my feet touched the concrete and my lungs took in the smog and my eyes rested upon this city, I found something so paradoxically complex and simple it intrigues me to this day- \nI found humanity and everything changed.\n\nHumans are not completely different from the other bastions of civilization I have come across, but they hold a sort of social depth that I had never encountered before. My curiosity was immediately ravenous and seemingly overnight I joined in to the bustling cityscape; Routines, rituals; I made friends and my friends introduced me to coffee. Coffee! What a glorious, glorious thing! Coffee... that\'s how I met her.\n\nAfter years of assimilating and joyous investigation of humanity I finally felt as though I was home. The centuries of wandering were over for me; I had found everything I was looking for- or so I thought. Then the day came when I decided to go to a new coffee shop. It was right around the corner the whole time since I arrived and I had never been! It\'s strange how things like that work out, but there I was, standing in line, trying to decide if I would try something new or go with a classic. She was behind the register. I was so preoccupied by what I was going to get I didn\'t even see her at first.\n\n""May I have a white chocolate, raspberry mocha with six shots of espresso, please?"", I asked when I stepped up to the counter, my gaze locked on the overhead menu searching for something I might flip-flop to.\n\n""Wow, that\'s what I call a pick-me-up,"" she said through a chuckle. \n\n""Yeah,"" my eyes falling to meet hers; one green, one blue- fascinating, ""I- I really like coffee.""\n\nShe pushed a streak of blue hair behind her ear joining it with the rest of the ocean on her head, \n""Who doesn\'t!?"", She said, beaming a smile that I felt with every nerve ending. ""That will be...""\n\nI was snared. Everyday after that I returned to that shop every chance I could. There was this inexplicable feeling I had that drove me to learn as much as I could about this anomaly- this woman. She must have been intrigued with me as well because after weeks of interactions at the shop, when I felt there was more to know- things that a patron could not ask from a clerk- I asked if she wanted to spend time together outside- anywhere doing anything- and she agreed! Walks through the park turned into lunches, lunches turned into dinners; before long, we were spending every day together. What started as research turned into bliss.\n\nI had long since buried any feeling such as that and feeling it again made me forget the inevitable truth: all things end. One day, her hair colored changed; what was a calm ocean turned into a volcano of red and orange. The smile I had felt ripple through my body diminished, and then came the note:\n\n""I\'m sorry. Goodbye.""\n\nI have lost so many times. So many times I\'ve picked up and moved- started over; a new town, a new country, new planet, new galaxy. This was a new situation. I wasn\'t going to give up- not yet. That\'s when I decided to change form. I had kept the same appearance the whole time I was in that city- I did it for her, but she didn\'t want that form. So I changed. Whole new me; whole new chance. I found her again, and again, and again- each new me found her and each new me lost her.\n\nIt\'s been countless years since I wandered into that coffee shop and I\'ve tried countless versions of myself trying to hold on to this anomalous woman, but to no avail. In the past I would have moved on, but something keeps me in pursuit. Time has never been an issue for a being such as myself, but for her it\'s not so kind. Each time I change, I align my appearance to match her age, but I know it won\'t last forever. As long as we can share time, the pursuit is worth it. \n', '**THUD!!**\n\n""Ow! God damnit!!"" He thought to himself so loudly he was certain that someone must have heard it. ""Remind me to apologize to every bird outside my office. You really can\'t see the glass in the window can you? Well at least we know Windex really is worth the few extra bucks""\n\nIrvine still hadn\'t gotten used to the bird body despite it being his primary mode of transportation around the over crowded city. ""Or is it Vincent? No, no Vincent was last month. I thought using the names from my favorite videogames would make this identity thing easier"" He spotted her in her usual place walking through the park after her day at work and drifted down to a remote corner in the trees to phase back into being a human. Shaggy black hair, little bit of facial shadow, eyes some kind of hybrid of green and brown, medium build. ""Alright, let\'s try this again"" he said with a deep sigh and walked out on the trail.\n\n**THUD!!**\n\n""Oh my god I\'m so sorry"" he said kneeling down to scoop up the papers that had been scattered running into Isabel. The Apple of Aries\' eye. For months they\'d been dating on and off. Unbeknownst to her of course. To her, Serge was just another klutz who spent too much time looking at his phone and not enough time watching where he was going. ""If I don\'t text my mom right back, she starts to panic and next thing I know the police are knocking on my door. Or asking the receptionist at the gym if I\'ve checked in. It\'s happened more than once."" ""Oh, that\'s alright. Thank you"" She said with a sparkle in her limpid blue eyes that Leon had never seen in anyone else before. Maybe it was that, that drew him to her. She seemed unremarkable in nearly every other way, but in a way that seemed deliberate. As if she was trying to hide something amazing about herself from the outside world.\n\n""I\'m Andrew"" said Dante extending his hand with the palm facing a little more upward than someone who would be shaking the hand of a person they just met. He knew her hands were soft. He knew she would place her delicate fingers in his palm and he would close his hand around them. With no small amount of luck, or tremendous amount of luck if any of his past attempts were any indication, he\'d hold her hand every day. ""Isabel"" she responded.\n\nIt was a dance he\'d done countless times before and he knew each step of each beat. He was a virtuoso at this point. After days upon weeks upon months of practice, he could do it from muscle memory. Asking the right questions, peaking the right interests, but not so much as to seem too good to be true or come off as a stalker who was just sizing up his next victim. ""Are you thirsty? It\'s been a long day for me and I\'m going to stop for a coffee. Would you care to join me?"" With a bit of a snicker she replied ""No thank you, I need to be on my way. I\'ve got a few projects I need to get the ball rolling on."" The glisten he saw in her eyes, like a lens flare in a movie made the hair on his neck stand. ""Oh.. well.. It was nice talking to you Isabel. Sorry about earlier again."" ""Oh don\'t worry about it, have a nice day"" she giggled and went on her way.\n\nDefeated he walked into the coffee shop, so as to not seem as if it was all a wholly concocted scheme. ""Fuck me!"" Duke thought to himself. ""I look like everything she likes in a guy! I share all her interests! I know practically everything about her! What more do I have to do!?""\n\n""Maybe try being honest, and stop trying so hard Harvey Birdman. And by the way you\'re lucky I didn\'t crush you in my bathroom last week, SpiderMan. Don\'t be a perv. Oh, and lastly, I\'ve been a gamer all my life. So don\'t think next time, when you say your name is Gordon Freeman that I won\'t get the reference.""\n\nTim whipped his head around frantically! Running out of line and over to the window. There on the other side of the road stood Isabel with a twinkle in her eye and a smile that went from ear to ear.\n\n""I\'ll see you next time, Luigi"" she laughed. It was as if he could feel her breath on his ear. He watched in astonishment as she walked, unremarkably down the street, with her files in one hand and an ipod in the other.\n\nNathan smiled.', 'Delilah hung up her jacket and took off her shoes. Another dud date. This one was cute. Almost as though he was made to be her type. Tall, dark hair, subtly muscular.  And only one dimple. He checked off all the boxes too. He worked as an EMT, bleeding heart type. He liked classic rock and k-pop. Game of Thrones and Gilmore Girls were his go to TV shows (what were the odds of that one). But when they had kissed at the end of the date it just felt flat. No fireworks. Delilah had been through swaths of men and none of them compared to that first love. The one that got away.\n\n&nbsp;\nShe put her curly brown hair into a ponytail and took out her contacts. She sighed after putting on her arm flannel pajamas. She shaved her legs for nothing. Again. How many had she gone through now? Twenty? She had been using online dating most recently. There were a lot of good options, firemen, doctors, professional athletes. But they all felt so fake. Like they were trying to be something they weren‚Äôt. \n\n&nbsp;\nWhen she had first met Emmet she wasn‚Äôt interested at first. She didn‚Äôt usually go for small waifs like him. He had freckles like her and not even one dimple. Not to mention his wild red hair. But when they started to speak at a mutual friends‚Äô party it just clicked. She felt like she could speak to him forever. Sure he hated Gilmore Girls and worked as an accountant for a faceless corporation, but he was kind and when he touched her hair. Fireworks. They dated for eight months. And for those months she was truly happy. They would play punch buggy or watch a movie just to make fun of it. They just fit. But one day, Emmet said he couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. She never fully understood why he was breaking up with her. He said something about meeting other people and being physically compatible. But she had always been attracted to him. So maybe he just wasn‚Äôt into her. No fireworks. \n\n&nbsp;\nAs Delilah watched TV she thought of the string of men that had followed. First there was Bruce, the hottie at the gym. She had given him the side eye even when she was with Emmet. He asked her out not even two days after her break up. It was like he knew she was freshly single. At first she said no; she was in too much pain. But a rebound friend with benefits situation did help. For a short while at least. And while he was hot and very good in bed, he felt fake. No fireworks.\n\n&nbsp;\nShe had dated the doctor for three months. He worked in pediatrics so of course she had to give him a try. But even though she wanted so badly to fall in love him, she soon realized she didn‚Äôt. Then there was the cook, the rocker, the one covered in tattoos, the one without any tattoos at all. Sometimes they went on a couple dates, sometimes more. But she had gotten almost good and sliding out of their lives when she realized that spark wasn‚Äôt there. Or that she wasn‚Äôt over Emmet. Sometimes one of them would bite his lip like Emmet did. Or she would see freckles on his cheeks for just a moment. Or their laugh would get shrill like his always did. Sometimes she felt like she saw him in every one of them. But they weren‚Äôt him. So they weren‚Äôt good enough. \n\n&nbsp;\nDelilah sighed and looked over to her phone lying next to her on her couch. She wished she still had Emmet‚Äôs number, but he had changed it long ago. It was like he had completely disappeared. Maybe she would see him again one day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEmmet shifted back from tall and burly to his natural size as soon as he reached his apartment. This version had not worked either. He thought Delilah liked buff men. And he mentioned every favorite song and TV show he could without raising suspicion. But he could tell from the look in her eyes that she wouldn‚Äôt call this one back. What was he doing wrong? He brushed his fingers through his red hair and bit his lip. He would win Delilah‚Äôs heart again. But how?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: More added below. Thanks for the encouragement. ;)', '""I don\'t know... I just got out of a relationship and need to figure out myself first. I think I\'m just looking to be friends right now.""\n\nThat same line every time. What a pallid lie it was. I kept trying to imitate what I thought she liked and every time it felt like I had gotten closer, but it never stuck. We\'d always end up taking this same stupid walk near her house and she\'d stop by this same shitty bench and she\'d say those same words, give a small hug and disappear into the distance. Ironic, for a man who could be anyone or theoretically do anything to end up in this Groundhog Day-esque scenario over and over.... and over. A few forms ago I got to a fourth date with her and we made out a bit, but she had stopped me and we had gone on this same walk in the end anyways.\n\nI slunk sadly back to my apartment, thinking about the disappointing night. My approach had gotten more refined- tattoos on arms, glasses, a little muscular but slim seemed to be the most consistent- and personality I hadn\'t gotten down yet either. Currently I was rotating through skin colors and hair texture to see if that made a difference. I don\'t think it did, really. I would throw something in from a few forms ago every now and then - large biceps and gym rat personality had gotten to a third date, but ended up as broken as all the previous ones. Nothing but those same words and that ridiculous sorry look on her face.\n\nShutting the door once I was inside, I set myself down in my office chair and grabbed my camera, snapping a selfie on the old-fashioned polaroid and began taking notes on the back. I suppose my detailed process had forced the second room in my apartment to look a little bit erratic, sure. But I had to document my progress and notes on what seemed to have an effect and what didn\'t, I couldn\'t keep track otherwise. My walls were plastered with polaroids of my different forms, copious information about her and her preferences. I don\'t like feeling like a creep, but I needed her, and I needed her to need me. \n\nI went to my fridge, grabbed a beer and my newest notebook, and went back to my room to study. I was getting desperate. I kept trying to think of how to get closer, how to figure her out and get her to spill what exactly she was looking for in a romantic partner. I kept looking at my notes covering the walls, trying to figure out what I could do differently.\n\nAnd suddenly I had a thought. Maybe when I was a man I was just too intimidating... she did keep herself more veiled around them. Perhaps if I could approach her- just as a friend- she would come to share more with me over time, and then I could get it right later. I changed forms again.\n\nI knew she had that open art workshop on Thursday nights, so I spent all of Wednesday and late into the night practicing with my new voice to get every nuance down. \n\nWhen I arrived at the class, I could feel my heart beating in my chest. I hoped this would finally be the time she could learn to talk more with me, and hopefully in a few more forms I would have it down and I would finally be perfect for her. \n\nI tried to not look over, to be nonchalant for once. \n\nShe stood there at the entrance with her easel in hand, quietly sipping on her coffee, and wandered over and took the empty seat next to me. \n\nShe greeted me, I tried out my new higher voice and we talked on and off as we worked on our pieces, her asking me questions about myself with vigor. This was working, for once. I\'d spend a bit more time getting to know her, then take that information and be the man she always wanted.\n\nBut then I saw a look in her eyes I hadn\'t seen before. She smiled coyly. ""Wanna grab a drink later?""\n\nI mean, that did explain a lot, in retrospect. For someone who prided himself on being observant, evidently I missed this one. \n\nAt the bar and several cosmos in, I was losing coherency as she told me story after story I had never heard. The tension between us was palpable... The woman I wanted and knew so much about was melting before me and flirting like never before. She finally suggested we head back somewhere more private... I said my apartment was just around the corner in my drunken stupor, and she dragged me out of there by my arm. \n\nThis was it. I felt myself trembling as we barely sloshed home to my apartment. I kept stumbling. I don\'t think my alcohol tolerance had caught up to me in my smaller body now.\n\n""Waitwait"", I barely slurred out once inside my door, ""Leeetme tidy up my bed, njust a second.""\n\nI threw my clothes, trash and every other unkempt item in the room hastily into my closet, and went back out to get her.\n\nBut she stood further up the hall, at the doorway to my second bedroom, looking inside and frozen in fear. ', 'He stared at the empty seat before him. She was gone again, rejecting him in record time. He wiped a tear from his eyes. For him, it had been barely a day since her funeral and that of his sons. He‚Äôd failed again. He never got used to it. No matter how many times.  \n\nThey were fated lovers that neither time nor death could separate and yet doomed to their own version of hell - he in his endless struggle to rewrite the ending that started it all and she in her blissful ignorance of their woven destiny. \n\nIf only she could remember him. If she could remember the lifetimes they‚Äôd spent, the countless sleepless nights entwined beneath the stars dreaming of growing old together. And the children they shared - would share, again. \n\nHe remembered them, too. They were his personal burden, memories and pain that only he knew existed. He bore it willingly, no matter the grief that inevitably fell to him alone to bear. \n\nHe glanced at his watch, the time was about right. He needed to get back to the machine. The machine that was both a curse and a blessing. He would make it work this time. He‚Äôd try something else.\n\nHe hailed a cab outside the restaurant. As he rode through the rain swept streets of the city he silently hoped the next jump would bring him to someone a bit more to her liking. \n\nA short while later he was back in his lab. The machine sat before him, humming in its usual patient manner. With a quick motion he adjusted the knobs, as he had done so many times before, and gripped the conductive rods to either side. \n\nThe humming grew in intensity. The building around him began to shake. He grimaced as electricity coursed through his body. He squeezed his eyes shut as he held on to the machine with all his might. \n\nHis last thoughts before the pain overwhelmed him was of her. He would start again. And this time would be the last. \n\n', '""You look *incredible*,"" I said, snapping a picture and handing Dani\'s phone back. ""No filter necessary. James won\'t know what hit him.""\n\nDani nodded absently, her eyes already glazing over as her thumb tapped over the surface of her screen. ""Thanks, Tanya. You said he rides a motorcycle, right?""\n\nMy heart sank: I had seen this level of disinterest uncountable times in the past few years, and already I could see how the date would go: James would make his dashing arrival on his motorcycle (but wearing a helmet, gloves, and leather jacket; Dani hated recklessness). In the bar (a nice cocktail bar, she liked to be treated but hated to feel pressure) he\'d order a bottle of white wine and some stuffed mushrooms, his tongue already tying in knots as he realized she had already found something in him wanting, because no matter how nice Dani tried to be, she was just too easy to read. Or maybe she was only easy to read for me, because I wasn\'t only Tanya, her best friend, I was going to be James in less than two hours, and I\'d been Mark and Jose and Chris in the dates before that, and a war hero fifty years before that, and a merchant sailor two hundred years before that, and on and on, so far that I couldn\'t even remember my original body, gender, or name. Half the time I wasn\'t even sure I had been born a human, but every year that passed I became certain that it didn\'t matter: the immortality and the shapeshifting had changed me so much that I certainly wouldn\'t die as one.\n\nBut Dani had changed all that. Ever since I, in the form of Tanya, had first met her at school, while pursuing my thirty-fourth degree, I\'d found myself feeling alive again. I\'d been with brilliant women, with beautiful women, with talented women, with powerful women, but never a woman as kind and compassionate as Dani. For the first time in centuries I\'d begun using my powers for good again, instead of just slipping through existence as unobtrusively as possible. We\'d become friends, we\'d become roommates, and for a while that had been enough. But not anymore.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, I said, ""Please, give him a chance, Dani. You\'re so cautious. Just live a little! Go with your gut! What if he\'s the one?""\n\nDani smiled. ""I hope you didn\'t tell him I could be \'the one\'. It\'s fun to get out in the city and meet new people but...I don\'t think I\'m in a good place for a boyfriend.""\n\n""That\'s what you\'ve said for years,"" I said. Dani had been dating a real asshole when I first met her, a prick who\'d been with her since high school. Even though she hadn\'t seemed really traumatized by the breakup, she hadn\'t dated since. ""You\'re young! You\'ve got a good job, you\'re living in a beautiful city! I\'ve set you up with some really amazing people!""\n\nDani laughed. ""Maybe you\'ve done too good a job, Tanya. If the next guy wasn\'t going to be so cool, maybe I could settle for the one I was with.""\n\nI shouldn\'t have snapped, but I hated it when she deflected. ""I just want you to be happy, and have someone! You\'re not going to have this opportunity forever."" I said it more bitterly than I meant, because I knew I was wrong: as long as Dani lived, she would have someone trying to be with her.\n\nDani\'s back stiffened. ""Well, maybe you should date some of these awesome guys yourself, then, so you don\'t end up like me.""\n\nI couldn\'t hold back a smirk at that imagery. ""Come on, Dani--""\n\nBut the smirk had only pissed her off more. ""You know what, Tanya? Don\'t bother anymore. You can have them all to yourself. Just don\'t set me up with anyone again.""\n\n""But--d"" I was stunned. I\'d never seen such a rapid transformation in her before. This wasn\'t just about what I\'d said, there was something else going on with her. And I knew it would be stupid to try and ask her as Tanya. I\'d have to ask her as -- ""James?""\n\n""Oh, don\'t worry, I won\'t stand him up."" Dani grabbed her purse. ""I\'m not *that* much of a bitch. I would tell you not to stay up but I don\'t think I\'ll be that late.""\n\n*\n\nAs James, I shut off my motorcycle and looked over the sidewalk, my eyes meeting Dani\'s and then looking away again, as if I wasn\'t entirely convinced it was her. I had a right to that thought; she\'d undergone almost as big a transformation as I had, all her anger with Tanya gone from her face.\n\nI needed time to build up trust, to find out what was actually going on with her, so I played it safe, smiling widely as I wrapped an arm around her shoulder (Dani found full-frontal hugs too intimate for a first meeting but thought a handshake too formal; thus, I always went for the three-second side-hug.) We made idle small talk as we placed our order, and I waited for any expression, any word that might clue me in to what she was actually feeling.\n\n""So how\'d you meet Tanya?"" she asked after the waitress had dropped off our bottle of Chardonnay. ""She never tells me how she meets people.""\n\nHer voice barely tightened around the name *Tanya*, but I could see that she was still angry. My stomach twisted. What if, in trying to make her fall in love with me, I wound up losing her friendship as well? ""At a club down east,"" I said. ""She\'s pretty fun. You\'ve been friends for a while, right?""\n\n""Yeah. Since college."" Dani lifted her glass and swirled it, but didn\'t drink.\n\n""I can tell she cares a lot about you,"" I said. ""You wouldn\'t believe all the questions she asked making sure I was good enough for you.""\n\n""Yeah."" Dani sighed. ""She\'s got *great* taste."" Then, realizing what she\'d said, ""I\'m sorry. You seem really great. She\'s just...clueless.""\n\nThe sarcasm was so obvious that I couldn\'t let it go. ""Are you guys OK?""\n\n""Yeah."" Dani sounded so defeated that my stomach twisted again. Tanya was the shape and attitude in which I felt most comfortable. I liked to think that she was pretty similar to who I\'d been originally; it was so easy for me to be her that the thought of Dani not being friends with her anymore was almost a worse rejection than the scores I\'d experienced as the dates.\n\n""Yeah,"" Dani said again. ""We\'re OK. Just, OK. I guess that\'s got to be good enough. Look, I...this isn\'t going to go anywhere, OK? I think I owe it to you to tell you that as soon as I can.""\n\nI said, ""Yeah. I figured.""\n\n""I\'m sorry. I just..."" Putting her glass down, she twisted her hands around her napkin. ""...I think I go on all these dates because each time I hope maybe something magical will happen, and I can get over all the other bullshit but...that won\'t happen. I just have to accept both sides of the coin. I\'m not going to get over it, and Tanya, she...she isn\'t ever going to feel the same.""\n\nMy jaw dropped. ""*Tanya*?""\n\nShe nodded. ""Yeah. Sometimes I think there\'s something there, but she just keeps sending me on dates with everyone else in the world. I get so angry, but it\'s not her fault; she just wants me to be....""\n\nShe was so caught up in her napkin that she didn\'t notice me transforming until the sentence was almost done. James fell away. Tanya resurfaced. Dani\'s eyes widened. ""...happy,"" she whispered.\n\nI said, ""I\'m sorry. I...I\'m an idiot.""\n\nDani\'s mouth opened and closed several times. She reached for her glass of wine and found the bottle instead, but still almost drained it. Then she took a deep breath.\n\n""Do you want to go back home?"" she asked.', ""**Off-Topic Discussion**: All top-level comments must be a story or poem.

I\'m sorry, you\'re a great guy, just not who I\'m looking for."" Amanda tightened her lips. There was no trace of a smile or any sign of guilt. There never was. This time, she had obviously rehearsed her words. *How do I let him down gently?* I bet that\'s what she was thinking. She was always so gentle. I sighed.\n\n""It\'s okay. I figured when you stopped answering my phone calls it was through. Can you tell me what I did wrong?"" Anything she would give me, perhaps it would help. Amanda tapped her fingers against the restaurant\'s table. A sign she was nervous. \n\n""Nothing... you were perfect. Just. I don\'t know, Alex, what do you want me to say?"" She placed both hands down on the table, apologized once more, and stood to leave. I had already tuned out her words, and had begun to stare at the eyelash she had let fall onto her cheek. \nAs she left, her silver hair dancing behind her. She needed to re-dye it, it had started to fade.  *This one was no good too?* I thought I had become everything she wanted to be this time. Impossible not to admire, I watched and wanted everything about her. Her faded silver hair, the freckles on her shoulder, the eyelash on her cheek. The coal eyes asking me for more, even though I had never seen those. One day she would want me, love me, *revere* me, just as I did her. *I just had to try again.*\n\nThis time my name was Alex. Back when I had been a Jack... or was it Jerrell... I had discovered her favorite name was Alex. I wanted to be her favorite everything. Of course, I knew she loved blondes more than anything else, with eyes as deep and green as her mother\'s. I crafted a beautiful back story about how close I was to my nonexistent sisters. I was the perfect gentleman. All of my choices and decisions... she agreed with all of them.\n\nFor her, I was perfect, so what did I have to change this time? She couldn\'t even tell me. After fifty faces, fifty different lives, what type of person had I not made myself before? Staring at the empty doorway where Amanda had been, I clenched my fists.\n\n""Maybe I\'ve been thinking about this the wrong way."" I rushed to the nearest bathroom, and began to piece myself together again.\n\nThe first thing I needed to do was buy a new phone. A new life, a new form, a new number.\n\nA new chance. \n\n""Hi, I would like to buy a phone and look into starting a contract today.""\n\n""Yes ma\'am, I\'d be happy to help you with that.', 'Adam examined himself in his bathroom mirror, thirty minutes to go before his next date with Danica. He flashed his most charming smile. His teeth were the right shade of white and the corners of his mouth were symmetrical, but he still wasn‚Äôt getting perfectly natural-looking wrinkles around his eyes. As he held the smile in place, he rubbed two more wrinkles onto the skin at the corners of each eye. He tried again. Still not quite right. \n\nHe walked over to his computer, opened a new tab, and tried a modified search: ‚ÄúMost Natural looking eyes in Hollywood.‚Äù The results were surprisingly divergent from the ‚ÄúBest looking eyes in Hollywood.‚Äù He studied the image of Zac Efron. The curves of Zac‚Äôs eye wrinkles were more elongated than Adam had previously noticed. He walked back to the bathroom mirror and tried stretching out his own wrinkles. Sure enough, the result was more satisfying.\n\nAs Adam beamed his smile, that creeping, persistent thought came to him once again, ‚ÄúYour looks are not the problem. YOU ARE!‚Äù. He pushed against it, reassuring himself as he gazed at his own beautiful face. ‚ÄúYou are beautiful. You are gorgeous. You are flawless. You‚Äôre smart, funny, and creative. Not to mention rich. Any woman would be lucky to have you.‚Äù\n\nThis would surely be the version of himself that Danica would love. His facial skin was just the right color, a subtle golden-bronze, and texture, soft and supple, to balance his muscular features. His reddish-brown hair was long and lustrous, but pulled back into a reserved man-bun. He was 6‚Äô3‚Äù. Tall, but not so tall that there would be an awkward difference in heights. His smile was tuned. His walk was calibrated. Even the creases of his muscular arms were shaped to Danica‚Äôs body, made for her personal comfort. \n\nYet his mind persisted in its assault, ‚ÄúA real man wouldn‚Äôt need to look like this.‚Äù\n\nHe pushed the thought out of his mind again. He wasn‚Äôt just real, he was great. Who was as clever? Who as athletic? Who as sweet? Who loved with the kind of passion that he loved?\n\n‚ÄúYou are the greatest,‚Äù he whispered to his reflection. ‚ÄúThis will be the night. I am sure of it.‚Äù ', 'Roger furrowed his brow and put his sweaty, clammy hands on his forehead, his elbows on his knees.  The plastic and cloth seat beneath him had finally warmed and become comfortable, as the seat next to him felt cold, its occupant having just left.  Her navy peacoat flailed slightly as she buttoned the double breasts and walked down the four steps off the bus leading to the curb.\n\nThe doors closed, and the seat beside Roger became colder.  The navy peacoat drifted out of sight.  He loosened his tie, rubbed his hands on his pants, and let his mind slip into a deep, empty, trance.  What had transpired minutes before was painful, and a wound this fresh cannot be ignored, moved past, or relived without more pain.\n\nThe woman he loved, the woman he had spent the past five years of his life trying to re-connect with, had just walked out on him for the sixth time.  Each instance of ""Roger"" had failed to capture her interest for more than a year, and almost all had failed before the first date.\n\nThis wound was deeper than all previous ones, and would likely not heal.  Yes, this would be Roger\'s last attempt, as the woman he loved and who had once loved him had grown and changed so much that he felt he no longer knew her.  The first incantations of Roger were not quite what he could consider to be ""Roger"", but what he considered to be better versions.  Better hair.  Better Muscles.  Better smile.  But alas, each version became more and more like the real Roger, and each one coming that much closer than its predecessor to connecting with her. \n Roger in his current form was the real ""Roger"" in almost every way, and is what made this wound so deep.\n\n""This will be the last time I try,"" he decides.  ""I must accept that my widowed wife no longer loves me.""', ""‚ÄúTwo raspberry mojitos please‚Äù, I told the waiter, ‚Äúand can we get a plate of sushi to share?‚Äù\n‚ÄúCertainly, Sir‚Äù\n\nI looked up at my date, hoping to find some sign that she is pleased that I ordered her favourite drink. It took 10 dates before I discovered it about her, 12 dates before I found her love of sushi and 19 dates until I was confident that I could put together her perfect date. \n\n‚ÄúMy favourite! How did you know?‚Äù Belinda said as she crossed her long legs towards me. She looked particularly good tonight. She picked the perfect date to be wearing my favourite short red dress. There is something about her smile that makes me melt, a familiar, comforting feeling.\n‚ÄúIt's your favourite? No, its my favourite!‚Äù I replied, feeling only a little disgusted with how cutsie I was being. \n\nSo far so good. This plan was going to work, I just need stay cool and follow the plan.\n\nI was confident this date was going to be the one. Tonight I shape shifted into what I have learned is her ideal man. I am tall, much taller than last time, with long blonde hair tied up in to a man bun and piercingly blue eyes. It certainly wasn‚Äôt my first choice of shape but I‚Äôm not holding it against her.\n\nThe waiter returned to the bar with our drinks. It was time to bust out my next move. I opened my wallet and a loyalty card for the local yoga studio ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô flew out on to the table.\n\n‚ÄúOops, I mustn't have put my card back when I finished my yoga session earlier‚Äù, I faked an embarrassed look and quickly returned the card in my wallet.\n\n‚ÄúI. Love. Yoga. I have been doing it for the last 15 years. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre into that.‚Äù She said before taking a long sip from her mojito.\n\nI do my best to suppress a smirk. ‚ÄúI know, this never happens‚Äù.\n\nI am going to have to get used to this body i‚Äôm in, especially since now we are going to get married and have 10 children. Probably move out to the country and get a big property with horses.\n\nOK, I can‚Äôt overdo it now. Take it easy, just enjoy her company.\n\nBelinda looks up and cocks her head toward the speakers.\n\n‚ÄúSweet child o‚Äô mine, I love this song!‚Äù\n\nFunny, my ex-girlfriend was crazy about Guns ‚Äòn Roses, Belinda is a jazz nerd.\n\n‚ÄúOh, I thought you were more of a jazz girl?‚Äù\n\n‚Äúuh, yeah, I am. Absolutely. This is a guilty pleasure of mine that‚Äôs all.‚Äù She finishes her mojito in one slurp and lets out a satisfied ‚Äòah‚Äô sound. That‚Äôs another familiar sound.\n\nAlarm bells are going off in my head. \n\n‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your favourite movie?‚Äù I ask, watching her carefully for the response.\n\nWithout hesitation she blurts out, ‚ÄúThe Burbs‚Äù.\n\nMy stomach sinks.\n\n‚ÄúTrista?‚Äù, I whisper. Hoping to be wrong.\n\nShe looks down at her feet and lets out a sigh.\n\n‚ÄúTrista, you can‚Äôt shapeshift to get back in my life.

I can‚Äôt believe she did this to me, it's so dishonest, so stalky. Look at her sitting there in that red dress. Long perfect legs. She looks up at me with that smile that has melted me 19 times before.

""--I stabbed myself in the gut, twisted it, pretended to be dead for an hour, and then changed into a wildebeast and ran back here to make it in time for our weekly chat.""\n\n""Mmhm.""

Artsy?"" He gritted his teeth, trying not to show how frustrated he was.\n\n""Sure, but that was ridiculous. Then the barbarian. What was that?"" She lifted her hands up in the air which also happened to summon the barkeep to look up with the face of attentive barkeeps everywhere that said *More?* so Piers waved his hand and shook his head.\n\n""Well, you did complain about the bard. You said you wanted someone more macho. Wasn\'t he macho enough for you?""\n\nShe chewed on her lip. She did that when she was thinking. He knew that about her. He knew everything about her. That\'s what made this whole thing so frustrating.\n\n""Yeah. And then almost a week to the day I meet the barbarian just happenstance to be on the road when I\'m out questing and he was so -- just over the top. He grunted and threw things and he flexed. A lot. He wore a loincloth on our date. A loincloth. It was embarrassing.""\n\nPiers was losing his patience just a little bit. ""So you\'re anti-barbarian.""\n\nShe huffed and she tapped her fingers on the table. ""I am not anti-barbarian. He was just so -- extra. Y\'know? Like a farce of a barbarian. That\'s not what I want.""\n\nExasperated, Piers said, ""Well what *do* you want? You said you wanted someone smart and so that week you met the scholar.""\n\nShe groaned in annoyance. ""Don\'t remind me. He read all the same scrolls I did and he went on and on about things that I like. It was so boring. Like I had that conversation a million times before. I have met stone walls more interesting than him.""\n\n""Then you said you wanted a bad boy and when you got that --""\n\nShe cut him off. ""--Don\'t even. He wasn\'t a bad boy. He was like some kind of weird trussed up dark elf gothic vampire wannabe who happened to be saving up to get a wyvern. The *same* wyvern that I\'m saving up to get. Of course."" She rolled her eyes.\n\n""Then what will make you happy Trisk?""\n\n""I don\'t know. I guess I\'ll know when I see him."" She sighed and stared back into her tankard.\n\nHe wanted to shout to her *When you see me! Why don\'t you see me?* but didn\'t because he couldn\'t because she had always been the little sister of his best friend. A best friend that had rules about friends and sisters and would be betrayed if Piers crossed that line.\n\nSo Piers crossed a line that neither of them knew he could. Every week. Hoping that one day he could get it right.']",380168,[]

There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I\'m taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.\n\nChanges in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won\'t go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.\n\nOn the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it\'s entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It\'s also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don\'t know.\n\nTldr: shits complicated literally\n\nedit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which *even scientists* do sometimes.\n\nPeople seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That\'s really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I\'m looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). \n\nUntil relatively recently we didn\'t even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I\'m sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don\'t know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don\'t know much about that. But we\'re learning.\n\nThere is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don\'t think that it will be the same in everyone.\n\nexample: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don\'t, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I\'m going?\n\nWe do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a ""fix"" but as a supplement. it\'s just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). \n\ntldr2: no really, shit\'s complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don\'t know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding. This is also why the human microbiome is so hard to study. Remember, none of this is well researched enough for there to be standardized advice for anybody outside of the normal ""live a healthy lifestyle"" advice, and slowly figuring out what makes you feel better. So don\'t ask for a quick fix and don\'t trust anyone who offers one.

Both are well-defined and different from gluten intolerance, which is less clear. \n\nThe most common explanation for increased allergies is the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that aggressive modern hygiene removes the parasites and bacteria that help calibrate the immune system, leaving it more likely to react to harmless targets.\n\nIt's also been suggested that modern wheat could be more allergenic. The cross-breeding of new wheat strains in the 1960s, which allowed us to feed billions of people, could have selected for a protein variant that immune systems just don't like. Modern wheat processing has also been noted as a potential contributor."", 'We are locking this thread because of the high number of off-topic and soapboxing/argumentative posts.', 'There\'s a great Netflix 4-part documentary called Cooked that delves into this. The documentary series 4 parts were titled Earth, Air, Fire & Water, and it looked at an anthropological history of our diets and hunting/eating/cooking rituals. The Air episode was all about bread, and about how it has been a staple of our diets for so long.\n\nTheir postulate was that for the vast majority of people, gluten isn\'t the issue. Sure there are some people for whom the gluten is the problem, they just assume it is because modern bread doesn\'t agree with them because of the accelerated processes they use to make it. Or perhaps there used to be something in bread that prevented gluten from having such an adverse reaction.\n\nIt used to be that bread was fermented. The dough was a living, breathing colony. In more recent years, to speed up the bread making process, instead of allowing the natural bacteria in the water supply to thrive in the wheat and change it - they instead use ""clean"" additives, such as yeast.  Due to this, there are various nutrients that used to be in bread that aren\'t any more, so manufacturers have also added fortifications in also, to make up for those that were missing and actually have it be nutritious. \n\nTLDR: The bread we eat now isn\'t really anything like the bread our bodies evolved with.

We have higher expectations for our own health now that we ever had in the past, so historically, people with a sensitivity to gluten may have just ignored it.\n\nFurther, while many people relied on wheat-based food products, it wasn't the only diet out there, and only became as dominant as it is now in the 20th century."", 'A documentary was made for this exact question.

[That\'s not true:](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain) \n\n> For reasons that remain largely unexplained, the incidence of celiac disease has increased more than fourfold in the past sixty years. Researchers initially attributed the growing number of cases to greater public awareness and better diagnoses. But neither can fully account for the leap since 1950. Murray and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic discovered the increase almost by accident. Murray wanted to examine the long-term effects of undiagnosed celiac disease. To do that, he analyzed blood samples that had been taken from nine thousand Air Force recruits between 1948 and 1954. The researchers looked for antibodies to an enzyme called transglutaminase; they are a reliable marker for celiac disease. **Murray assumed that one per cent of the soldiers would test positive, matching the current celiac rate. Instead, the team found the antibodies in the blood of just two-tenths of one per cent of the soldiers.** Then they compared the results with samples taken recently from demographically similar groups of twenty- and seventy-year-old men. In both groups, the biochemical markers were present in about one per cent of the samples.\n\nThe whole article is interesting, and it\'s well reported (it\'s from the New Yorker, not some sketchy clickbait ""GlutenAlert365.com"" meme your aunt posts on Facebook).

It was an article about fibre in our modern western diets.  and how we lack a lot of fibre in our diets and how the lack of fibre causes the lower intestines to not be healthy, getting swollen and enflamed.  When the lower intestines get to this stage, gluten can and has been shown to pass through the walls into the blood stream. At that point, once past the barrier,  problems occur.  It was a good read and I\'m sure I\'m paraphrasing it way wrong, but what I took from it, because our diets are bad in one way it\'s causing other problems to appear.  And you didn\'t have to have an allergy or Celiacs to see some of the problems appearing.   note: I think this is very different then the trend we are seeing today where everybody is afraid of the ""glutens"" \n\nI\'d love to find that old magazine or online version to re-read it and see how relevant it is. \n\n', ""The wheat of today and the wheat of our ancestors is vastly different in terms of constitution, cultivation and processing.

So people believe it needs to be eliminated from their diets.\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/diet/healthy-kitchen-11/truth-about-gluten"", ""Most people who do not eat gluten are not actually allergic to it, by which I mean they do not have a histamine reaction. There are, however, many other factors which discourage it's consumption.\n\n1. Genetic modification. Over the past fifty years especially, we have bred wheat to have more and more of the glutenous protein because it's what makes pizza and other bread products so stretchy and delicious. Our bodies may be having trouble keeping up. This means our gut can't digest it as easily. \n\n2. Processing. White bread was a miracle once! But it lacks the fiber, fats, and nutrients that wheat originally had. Bad for you? Maybe. Good for you? No. Bread products are rarely fermented anymore, which was arguably the most important step in being able to eat flour. Gluten causes awful neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms for me, but I can eat homemade (truly fermented) wheat sourdough no problem.\n\n3. Overabundance. Gluten and various derivatives are used in almost every processed food, so our consumption levels are somewhat camouflaged. This also means that when you cut out gluten, you're also cutting out a lot of preservatives, sugars, and other fairly undesirable food products.\n\n4. Inflammation. Whether due to our inability to digest it or other reasons, gluten is known to cause inflammation, in levels that vary person to person. Inflammation in your gut reduce your body's ability to absorb nutrients. Whether or not you're allergic to gluten, reducing systemic inflammation by not eating can have benefits in a wide variety of disorders, from MS to schizophrenia to Krohns and beyond.\n\n5. Chemicals. In America at least, many farms douse their fields in RoundUp just before harvest because it increases yield. That means the wheat is full of heavy chemicals. For Americans at least, we may not be allergic to wheat, but heavy chemicals can still mess you up pretty badly.\n\n[Here](https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain/amp) is a New Yorker article that discusses many factors. \n\nEdit: link"", 'Actual medically diagnosed gluten sensitivities, due either to Celiac Disease or allergy, remain extremely rare. There is zero evidence that either of those conditions are any more common today than they were a thousand years ago.\n\nHowever, they do exist. There are, and always have been, people among us who are negatively impacted by gluten. The difference is that those people now have access to social media where they can tell many, many people at a time how terrible their symptoms are. And a lot of those people hear that and wrongly believe that gluten is bad for everybody. They begin to manifest psychosomatic symptoms, futher convincing them. Then they find out, after further research, that not everybody has this sensitivity. But their imagined symptoms convince them that they themselves do. Thus is born their claim of gluten sensitivity in the absence of any medical diagnosis. \n\nThe same exact thing has happened with aspartame. There is an exceedingly rare condition called phenylketonuria that makes aspartame very toxic to its sufferers. I knew a girl in highschool who had it. Aspartame would give her seizures. But, like I said, it\'s rare. For anybody without phenylketonuria, aspartame is harmless. But the symptoms of phenylketonuria hit social media and people read about it and concluded that aspartame must be terribly toxic! The result is that a huge movement of scientifically illiterate people are now anti-aspartame. Nevermind that this logic is exactly the same as saying that nobody should ever eat seafood because some people are allergic to it.  (Personally, I avoid aspartame drinks because they all taste like the first syllable in ""aspartame"" - but I\'m not afraid of them.) \n\n', ""So there's a lot at work here.  Ignoring whether or not I believe anyone who said they have trouble eating wheat (because I'm not such an asshole that I'll call someone a liar about how they feel when they eat food) I'll say this.  5000 years is basically an evolutionary hiccup.  It's nothing compared to the million years we've been humans. Also, if we accept that something about eating wheat isn't ideal for the digestive system, then it stands to reason that the damage done is not short term.  Long term woes (those that occur over decades) don't really impact evolution. Moreover, the way modern people eat wheat IS dldifferent than it was in the past.  Our wheat is a different subspecies, it is prepared differently, in different quantities, and with greater frequency.  \n\nOn top of that  it's eaten WITH different things that compound bodily stress (that is to say, he amounts of sugar and corn products).  Hard to say whether the combinations might be important (like joker makeup). "", 'Combination of: \nA lot of people who claim a gluten allergy/sensitivity are just people eating better and blaming it on the gluten free part of their new diet--trading tons of pasta/pizza/cookies/etc. for fresh fruits and vegetables is bound to make anyone feel better\n\nHygiene hypothesis (and other possible causes) for an increase in allergies overall\n\nSome gluten tolerances were relatively minor annoyances ""back then"", it\'s only in modern times that we have time and energy to worry about things like stomach aches\n\nAnd finally, people with true Celiac disease simply died.

I work in the stock market and my little brother asked me to explain what was going on. Here was my response: \n\nLet‚Äôs say GameStop has 100 shares outstanding currently trading @ $20 per share (so if you own 1 share, you own 1%, 25 shares = 25% and so on) \n\nThat‚Äôs it. There are only 100 shares of GameStop. Throughout the day people are constantly buying and selling these shares for one reason or another (that‚Äôs why the stock price moves up and down constantly)\n\nNow, typically when you think about making money in the stock market you typically think ‚Äúbuy low, sell high‚Äù üìà. In other words, buying Amazon when it was cheap, and now it‚Äôs worth üí∞ üí∞ üí∞. In this case you would be speculating that the stock price of Amazon will go up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in the future\n\n- *fun industry term: you are  ‚Äúbull-ish‚Äù*\n\nHere is where the short selling comes into play. \n\nLet‚Äôs pretend You have a hedge fund. Alec‚Äôs hedge fund manager looks at GME (GameStop) and says ‚ÄúI think GME is over valued, it really should only be trading at $15 per share, not $20 ü§î ‚Äú\n\nIn this situation, He is speculating that in the near future, the GME stock price will go down (to $15). \n\n- *another fun industry term; he would be ‚Äúbear-ish‚Äù on GME*\n\nNow since the hedge fund manager thinks GME‚Äôs stock price will go down, He is going to try to make money on that guess by short selling (shorting) the stock. \n\nTo short the stock The manager is going to *borrow* some shares from someone else, bob, and sell them at the current market price (which is $20). \n\nLet‚Äôs say he borrows 10 shares (total of only 100 remember) and sells them at the New York stock exchange for $20. He made $200 ($20 x 10 shares)\n\nA while later, GMEs stock price suddenly dips (fun industry term: ‚Äúdown ticks‚Äù). It is now trading at $15. \n\nAlec‚Äôs hedge fund manager was right! now don‚Äôt forget, we borrowed the shares from somebody else so we have to give those back. Alec‚Äôs hedge fund manager goes to the New York stock exchange and buys 10 shares @ $15 and returns those to the lender. \n\nAlec‚Äôs hedge fund made $50 on that trade total (this is called ‚ÄúPnL‚Äù).\n\nSo the full life cycle: \n\n- *Borrowed 10 shares from ‚Äúbob‚Äù*\n- *Sold 10 @ $20 in the market* \n- *Bought 10 @ $15 in the market*\n- *Returned 10 shares to ‚Äúbob‚Äù*\n\nTotal profit = (10 x $20) - (10 x $15) \n\n\nOkay.... so now onto what is actually happening with GameStop. \n\nLet‚Äôs keep the example the same. GameStop has 100 total shares outstanding. \n\nNow a bunch of hedge fund managers all think the exact thing that Alec‚Äôs hedge fund manager thought  so they all short the stock with the expectation that the price will ‚Äúdowntick‚Äù in the future. \n\nHere‚Äôs the thing.... someone on Reddit pointed out that despite the fact that GameStop only has 100 shares available at any given time, there were actually 125 shares on loan to cover short sales. \n\nI know this part is confusing, which it should be. That doesn‚Äôt make sense mathematically. How can you have more shares loaned out than available? I‚Äôm going to gloss over those details and just say that it is possible, and does happen on occasion. \n\nNow when you have a stock that is over shorted like this, you have one major risk, which is called a ‚Äúgamma/short squeeze‚Äù . It does not occur often. \n\nIn a gamma/short squeeze, there are more shares loaned out than available. That is because all of those hedge fund managers thought the price would go down and got greedy and tried to make as much üí∞ as possible and over borrowed assuming they would be able to cover it. But, someone pointed that out on Reddit, and was able to get that information to go viral. Now with all of these new people buying the stock, it forced the stock price up, very quickly (supply and demand). \n\nJust like in the example, these hedge fund managers had to return the shares to the lender... the problem is, the stock price has gone up so much that if they have to ‚Äúclose their position‚Äù they‚Äôll lose a fortune. \n\n- *Example: I sold 10 @ $20 = $200*\n\nInstead of going down; the stock price went up to $400. I have to return the stock to the lender and the only way to do it is to go buy it back. So: \n\n- *I buy 10 @ $400 = $4,000*\n\n- *PnL = +$200 - $4,000*\n\ninstead of making money; I lost $3,800. \n\nThis is basically what is happening with GME on a much bigger scale\n\nEdit 1: \n\nLots of people asking about the ‚Äúloan‚Äù. It‚Äôs not really a loan in the way that you‚Äôre thinking. When you execute an order to sell a share, you are required to Mark it as either ‚Äúlong‚Äù or ‚Äúshort‚Äù. What this really means is, do you ‚Äúhave‚Äù the stock right now in your bank account, or are you ‚Äúable‚Äù to get it easily. So theoretically, everyone could be marking their orders as short sales, assuming the shares are easy to borrow and readily available, except, as the price goes up, people panic and start buying them all up and there aren‚Äôt enough to go around. This in turn drives the price up further. Hence the ‚Äúsqueeeeeeeze‚Äù\n\nTypical settlement of a trade occurs t+2. In other words, you‚Äôre required to deliver the shares you sold short to the counter party within two business days of execution\n\n\nEdit 2:  \n\nfor those asking about option expiration: \n\n\nAn option as like a coupon. It gives the coupon holder the right to buy or sell stock, at a given price, on a given date. \n\nThink about it this way. If I think that the stock price of GME is going to go up in the near future, I can buy a coupon (technically a call option) that gives me the right to purchase the stock for a set price at a later date. So if GME is @ $20, I may buy a call option that gives me the right to buy GME stock for $20 per share exactly one month from now (expiration). The idea is that within that time frame; the gme stock price will increase, thereby making my coupon valuable because it allows the owner to buy at a discount. \n\nOn the other side, you have someone who ‚Äúwrites‚Äù the contract. Essentially sells you the coupon. Let‚Äôs say GameStop is trading at $20, and you buy that $20 coupon. Well now, GameStop is trading at $400. So if your expiration is tomorrow you can ‚Äúexercise‚Äù it, and the writer is required to deliver your shares for the agreed upon price, $20. To do that, they‚Äôll probably have to go out and buy it at these exorbitant prices', 'Okay let me get this straight \n\nI‚Äôm Wall Street and I\n\n- borrowed a pillow, have to give it back on the 29\n- sold the pillow for $100 thinking I can buy it back for $50 before the 29\n- reddit bought the pillow I borrowed and now I can only buy it back at $3000\n- tomorrow is the 29 and I don‚Äôt have $3000\n- I‚Äôm screwed?', 'How does buying and selling stocks work?\n\n.\n\nI own an orange factory.

He makes sure that all the candy sales on the playground happen fairly. If a kid doesn't pay for the right price for the candy, or if the kid selling the candy just takes the money, Essie-C beats them up. Teachers at the school let this all happen because the kids like candy, they are better behaved when they have it, and Essie-C is generally a pretty trustworthy kid who is feared by the bad kids.\n\nA delicious new candy called Chee'umee has come out, but it's only available in Japan. It's the perfect candy in every way, EXCEPT that many of the batches spoil very easily. The candy is so good though, that people still buy it, even with the possibility that they might end up with spoiled batch. Normally the wrapper of the candy is bright metallic green, but when it spoils, it turns black.\n\nMelvin is friends with Essie-C. One day, Melvin has an idea and pulls Essie-C aside.\n\nMelvin: Hey Essie-C! Have you heard about this new Japanese candy called Chee'umee?\n\nEssie-C: Nope.\n\nMelvin: Well, it's really good and I want to sell it to the kids on the playground, but I don't have any with me. My dad is going on a business trip to Japan next month, and he can bring some back for me. Would it be cool if I sell the other kids IOUs? Then when I get the candy, They can exchange their IOUs for the candy!\n\nEssie-C: OK\n\nMelvin: Well, there's one more thing. The Chee'umee might spoil before the kids get to exchange the IOUs for it. If that happens, is it okay if I keep the money they paid for the IOU? The kids I'm selling to will need to understand that we might get a spoiled batch and their IOUs won't be worth anything.\n\nEssie-C: Sure. But you'd still have to give them the spoiled candy, if they want it.\n\nMelvin: No kid would want the spoiled candy!\n\nEssie-C: Them's the rules.\n\nMelvin: Fine...\n\nOn the playground, Melvin follows this plan and sells 140 IOUs, which are little slips of paper to all the kids on the playground. He makes a lot of money that day.\n\nLater that evening, Melvin talks to his dad, Sid Atell, at dinner. Melvin: Dad, when you go to Japan, do you think you could bring back some of that Chee'umee candy?\n\nSid: Sure, son! How much do you need?\n\nMelvin: Well, I was hoping for... 140 pieces?\n\nSid: Goodness, son! That's a lot! I don't think I can bring that much back. I can bring back, oh about 20 pieces. Would that be okay?\n\nMelvin: Sure I guess. Here's the money for the 20 pieces.\n\nMelvin figures he will just tell the 120 kids that their candy got spoiled on the trip back from Japan. But this is great for Melvin, because he only had to pay his dad for 20 pieces of Chee'umee!\n\nA month later, his dad returns from his trip to Japan with 20 pieces of candy, and all but 5 turned black. Melvin takes all the candy to the playground and exchanges all 5 of the shiny green metallic candies for IOUs. The 5 kids who got the green candies are excited and the candy is as delicious as advertised. The other kids are quite annoyed that so much of the candy spoiled. \n\n3 kids, Wally, Sam and Betty, are a little suspicious of Melvin, so they ask for their candies anyway. Melvin hands it over.\n\nWally, Sam and Betty open the candy and eat it. To their amazement, the candy is just as good! Better, even! The wrapper just turned black, but the candy itself is just fine! Wally, Sam and Betty tell all the kids on the playground to use their IOUs and get the candy even if it's in a black wrapper.\n\nMelvin is now in a tough spot. He goes to Essie-C for help, but Essie-C reminds him of the deal. All IOUs have to be exchanged, if the kid wants their black-wrapped candy.\n\nAs a last ditch effort, Melvin goes to the playground teacher, Mrs. Robin Hood to tell her of his predicament. All these kids have IOUs and they really want the candy, but he can't give it to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Holy cow thanks everybody for the awards.\n\nCleaned up some grammar."", ""I just wanna know what happened with gamestop.\n\nEdit: I've received so many good answers and I thank you all.

Why or why not is that an accurate description of what's going on? \n\nPeople aren't buying GME because they believe so much in GameStop (at least I'm pretty sure of that), it's purely a money making scheme, and they have to sell all these shares at some point to make their money, otherwise it would be a pointless exercise (or is the actual goal to bankrupt the hedge funds?).  So they get everyone excited, stock shoots up, the smartest people sell at the top, everyone else gets screwed. Isn't that what's going to happen here?\n\nEDIT: I've gotten a bunch of good explanations and conversations on this, basically, the action looks similar to a pump and dump because the price is being forced up, but it's really about screwing the hedge funds that were shorting stocks and overselling. So it's not an effort to hike the price and get out quickly, but to hike the price and force the hedge funds' hands.

For example, if Tesla is at $500 per share (stock), they could bet it‚Äôs gonna drop to $400. If it does they make money, if not, let‚Äôs say it goes up to $600, and they bought 10 shares, they have to pay ~5,000 ish dollars, because they bought ten shares and it went up. Their job is to do the opposite of investors, so they try to bet the market will go down instead of up.\n\nAnyways, people on r/wallstreetbets saw that hedge funds were betting that GME (gamestop) would short, (go down). So, they decided to get all 2 million people on that subreddit to join them in buying GME stocks. The idea is, if you buy a stock, the price goes up super slightly, and if millions of ppl buy a bunch of stocks, the price per stock will skyrocket.\n\nSo, WSB (r/wallstreetbets) did exactly this. GME was valued at $27 per share, and hedge funds began to bet that GME would short, so, WSB bough a TON of GME stocks, and forced the stock to skyrocket. GME hit $500 per share last night, meaning that multiple hedge funds had to pay BILLIONS of dollars. \n\nAll of this happening, and people are becoming millionaires everywhere. If you bough ONE share of GME at $27, and sold at the peak, ($500), you would‚Äôve made ~$441 profit, but people bough hundreds of thousands of shares, so they made millions.\n\nThis means hedge funds went bankrupt. The rich people lost all their money, and the poor became rich. For the retards on snapchat, this is where the story ends, but there‚Äôs a lot more to it. \n\nSuper powerful people saw this, and didn‚Äôt like they were losing money, so, they got in bed with brokerages, and made them get rid of the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù option for GME and a couple other stocks. Meaning that they took away everyone‚Äôs power of their own money, just because they lost some of theirs. GME crashed today, but there was no volume behind it, meaning that nobody sold, so there is no reason it should‚Äôve crashed. This means that somebody powerful manipulated the market and made it crash, which is EXTREMELY illegal. \n\nSo, WSB are the actual good guys here, and the government, along with many billionaires are in deep shit for removing the people‚Äôs freedom of finance and manipulation of the market, which basically means they toyed with peoples money.\n\nEdit: I just want to clarify, I am in NO WAY an expert.

This is so they can sell the shares of apple continuously to drive the price of the stock down and cause panic and selling event, then come in later to scoop up the shares at dirt cheap prices and pay off the borrowed shares. \n\nContinuing our example, lets say 1 week later, Apple is now trading at $50/share. Well the Hedge fund now can return my 10 shares, but it only cost them $500 instead of $1000. So they made a profit of $500. They can do this as many times as they want and will make money AS LONG AS THE PRICE GOES DOWN. **what about if the price goes up**? **This is where RISK MANAGEMENT comes into play.

So John has to buy at the higher price in order to close his position, but remember he can\'t close all of his position because there is not enough available shares for him to buy back. Also his loss is infinite because the price can theoretically go to infinity, If John had a million dollar short position, he\'s not on the hook for more than a million, he\'s on the hook infinite amount technically. **THIS IS THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH WE ARE WITNESSING.**\n\nSHORT SQUEEZE: \n\nOur Friend JOHN can choose to close his position only if the shareholder of GameStop agrees to sell to JOHN. If someone agrees to sell to JOHN at $100, then great he can close some of his positions, but what if they refuse? John must go to the next seller at $200 and buy the stock at $200/share. What if they refused? Next person at $300 and so on and so forth until he can close all of his position.

Then return the stock to the owner.\nTotal Profit = original stock price - dropped price - borrow fee\n\n Risk: If the company\'s stock rises instead of falling, you will sustain losses.\n Loss = Inflated Price + Borrow Fee - Original Price.\n This is hence considered a risky practice.\n \nBack to the story,\nIn lockdown GameStop was suffering major losses and it\'s stocks were dropping, so many big businesses and a large number of people decided to short it.\n\nIf you look back at the short procedure, there\'s a long waiting period.\n\nThe status at this waiting period is that you owe the original owner one stock. (The stock you borrowed and then sold and are now waiting for it\'s price to drop)\n\nNow suppose another person wants to short GameStop.\nThis person may borrow the stock that you just sold, from the person that you just sold it to. (In other words, this person will borrow one stock from the person who brought one stock from you).\n\nNotice the problem here.\nThere only one stock, but there are two people who owe someone that stock.\nIn other words, two people think they own a stock but there\'s only one stock available to own.\nSoon, there will be more people who owe a stock to someone, than the total stocks that are there.\n\nThis happened to GameStop, where 140% of it\'s stocks were sold as short. But there\'s not enough stocks for this many people to own.\n\nNow imagine the stock price goes up instead of down, (say the company did something great), people will panic and try to buy back the stocks they sold so as to not sustain losses. (Why do they buy back? Because they need to return the stock to the owner.)\nBut there are not enough stocks to go around. This will increase the demand of stocks and supply will be short, further increasing it\'s price, this cycle will continue and the stock price will keep on increasing because of the high demand and low supply. Note that this didn\'t happen yet.\n\n(Btw why are there not enough stocks? Imagine the story earlier, after noticing the rise in price, you decide to buy back the stock, but instead of asking the person you sold to, you ask the person currently owning the stock, now you return the stock to the original owner and you\'re relieved, but what about the person you sold the stock to the first time? There was only one stock which has returned to it\'s owner, there\'s still one guy who owes someone a stock and one guy who thinks he owns one stock.)\n\nNow comes reddit,\n\nNote: If many people buy a particular stock, it\'s price will increase because of the increased demand and shortened supply.\n\nThe small investors on r/wallstreetbets decided to take advantage by buying GameStop\'s stocks and increasing the stock price, this will start the chain I explained just now, where the people who have shorted will buy back to avoid losses, but due to the lack of stocks, it\'s price will further increase, and more people will pull out of the short and the price will increase again, and so on.\n\nBefore lockdown, the stock price was $4 apiece. Recently it reached $147, and one day later $345. The price is skyrocketing.\n\nThe big investors and billionaires that decided to short and take advantage are losing money in billions, while the small investors are making loads of money.\n\nBut GameStop is not as valuable as it\'s stock price, so this inflating bubble will burst, and the prices will crash.\nWhen this happens, if you invest by looking at the rising prices,  you will lose a lot of money, but you can profit if you short at the correct time.\n\nSigh.', "" \n\nFor people that don‚Äôt understand **shorting**; here is my best explanation at it (this is heavily inspired by a YouTube video)‚Ä¶\n\n**Shorting is when you think a company is going to do badly so you borrow that company stock from a broker and promise to pay them back later.**\n\nHere is a Non-Stock Example:\n\nImagine that you thought **apples were going to go down in value** and they currently cost **$1.**\n\nYou go to a shop keeper and ask if you can borrow an apple which you will give back later.\n\nYou borrow the apple from him and sell it someone for $1 and then wait for the price to change. If the price goes down to 50 cents then you can buy 2 apples for a dollar. You go back to the shopkeeper and give him back the apple.\n\n**He has an apple back and you have an extra 50 cents.**\n\n**In stock market terms you have shorted them apples**. Now replace the apples with stocks and you hopefully get the idea.\n\n2 other things worth mentioning about short positions f**irst you have to pay an interest rate** **on your short positions** because you're borrowing something.\n\nSecondly, **short positions can be greater than 100% of stock.**\n\n**Let‚Äôs get to GME**\n\nGME is a brick and mortar video game company, after Covid hit Gamestop **unsurprisingly** has a couple of bad months and revenue falls. GME falls to about $4 per share.\n\nLargely because of this many **big international investors essentially thought Gamestop was going to go bust and therefore shorted GME.**\n\nHoping to see it collapse, they didn‚Äôt see that there was some good news coming Gamestop‚Äôs way.\n\nFirstly in **Mid August our saviour Ryan Cohen started buying GME shares.** By December Cohens company had bought about 9 million share (13% GME).\n\nThen in January Cohen and some other CEOs were appointed to Gamestop‚Äôs board.\n\nThis gave Gamestop a huge advantage as **now they‚Äôve got a billionaire investor who‚Äôs experienced with running ecommerce companies** which is exactly the business model Gamestop needs to shift to.\n\nSecondly in **November PS5 and Xbox series X was released starting a new console cycle** which is good news for Gamestop.\n\nThirdly Gamestop **signed a deal with Microsoft which gave them a share of all of Xbox‚Äôs digital revenues**\n\nSo, what happened to the stock?\n\nFirstly, the institutions that were shorting GME bought more short positions to try to supress the stock price.\n\nThis chart shows that for example on January 11th **there are massive 4 million short positions** taken despite the fact that this was the day Cohens board appointments were announced.\n\nüì∑\n\nIn total 71 million short positions were taken even though Gamestop only had a float of 69.75 million shares. Remember you can have more short positions that actual shares.\n\nThis gets crazier because about 20% of Gamestop shares is held by insiders like Cohen. Insiders can‚Äôt sell easily because of regulations.\n\nüì∑\n\nThere is the same amount again owned by big institutions who don‚Äôt normally trade either.\n\nüì∑\n\n**So that leaves between 20 to 30 million actively traded stocks and 71 million short positions who all need to buy stock**\n\nThat is a lot of demand and not much supply. Wallstreet Bets realized this and determined that if they bought the stock and **held** they could force the price up which triggers a **short squeeze.**\n\nWhere people with short positions desperately buy into a stock and try to cover before the price gets too high. These people are losing money but covering now prevents them from bigger losses.\n\n**However because there isn‚Äôt enough stocks to go around the price of each stock jumps spectacularly**.\n\nRemember it costs money to shorter position forever because of interest **so they want to act fast** which is exactly what happened to Volkswagen in 2008. Where it breifly became the most expensive stock in history. **Which is exactly what is happening with GME right now!**\n\nüì∑\n\nUlitmatly Redditors made big money and **if you hold for longer you will make more.**\n\nThe 2 big short sellers who lost big money is **Melvin Capital and Citeron Resarch.**\n\n**You can tell that they are panicking because 2 days ago Melvin Capital had to be bailed out by 2 big insitutions which isnt good for them.**\n\n**There is a lot of short postions to be covered if you hold for longer the price for each stock will increase.**\n\nSecondly if you've seen anything about this in the news it's often spun as mental reddit investors ruin the market **there's three things worth saying here**:\n\nFirstly, wall street bets doesn't actually **hold much sway over the market itself as WSB is an internet forum not an institution**.\n\nSecondly, it's not as if the market was rational **beforehand it's just that only hedge funds used to be able to manipulate** it and this wasn't even clear manipulation obviously some of GME's rise is a function of speculation but there's a good argument that it was undervalued and over shorted to begin with.\n\nThirdly it's fundamentally a good thing that people are able to get into the stock market and make **money off GME as it might make things more volatile and harder for hedge funds.**\n\nBut fuck Wall Street.\n\ntl;dr: Melvin Capital and other big short shellers were caught with their dick in the cookie jar when they overshorted GME making GME shares go to the fucking moon. If you hold GME you could be able to go to fucking Alpha Centuri and bankrupt big short shellers"", ""Right, let's see if I can explain this. Obligatory am not a stock broker, so please take what I say with a grain of salt, and I definitely welcome any corrections for things I get wrong.\n\n-----\n\n##Stocks and Shares\n\nLet's say you have a company called CORP, and that company has a board of directors. Now CORP wants to become publicly traded, so they announce that they will sell one seat on the board for $20. Alice hears of this and thinks that's a pretty good deal, so pays them the money and now gets a small say in what the company does and in return CORP gets a little bit of extra money. This seat is a **share** in the company, which can be traded in something called the **stock market** (where people can buy and sell their stock in a company). \n\nNow as the years go on, CORP becomes a global company and now everyone wants to be at the table. Suddenly Alice's seat becomes really valuable. If Alice wants she can sell her seat for $100 now, or keep her seat and hope that CORP does better and sell it for more later on. Even though right now Alice doesn't have any more money in her wallet than she did originally, she is still worth more money because the seat she owns is now worth more. \n\nImportantly, when Alice does sell her seat, even if she sells it for $1000, CORP doesn't actually get any of that money - they already sold the seat to Alice a long time ago for $20. However, later on CORP might apply for a loan, and the broker might look at the price of the seats at their table (their **share price**). If the price is really high, that must mean the company is doing well for themselves so the loan is more likely to be approved. Also, if anyone ever owns more than half of the seats at the table, then that person also effectively owns CORP. So CORP really wants the price of their seats to stay high. \n\n##Short Selling\n\nSo what if CORP starts doing poorly? Well Bob 'Shorty' McScrooge might see this and see an opportunity to make money off of CORP's losses. So what he does is he goes to Alice and asks her if he can borrow her seat. She reluctantly says yes, as long has he promises to give it back in a month. He takes this seat and sells it to Joe for $100. As the days pass, the price of a seat at CORP goes down. When the end of the month comes around, Shorty buys another seat back, but now that the price has gone down he only has to pay $20 (meaning he effectively made $80 since he originally sold the seat for $100). \n\nLet's say now that after Shorty borrowed Alice's seat and sold it, CORP finds gold and now everyone wants to buy a seat again. Well now Shorty is in real trouble. At the end of the month, he still owes Alice her seat back, but now seats cost $1000 to buy. If Shorty can't find a way to make the seats cheap again, then he might go bankrupt.\n\n---\n\n## GameStop\n\nThis is pretty much what happened with GameStop (aka GME). They were doing really poorly and their share price was going down, so lots of billionaires borrowed stock (seats) and sold them, expecting the price to drop resulting in them making even more money at the cost of GME. Reddit realised this so bought all the stocks causing the price to soar, meaning the billionaires are going to have to spend lots of money to buy back their borrowed seats (costing them billions of dollars). Of course, losing billions of dollars is something billionaires would very much like to avoid. \n\n\n##  Robinhood App\n\nRobinhood is an app used by a lot of everyday people to trade stocks, and was the tool used by a lot of redditors to make GME's share price get so high. No matter what the billionaires did, more and more redditors started using Robinhood to buy more GME stock, causing the prices to get even higher (meaning the billionaires would have to pay *even more* to return their borrowed seats). So to try to drive the price down, Robinhood said it would no longer let people buy GME stock, and that they could only sell now (remember, the seats at the table are only worth something if people are able to buy them). This is illegal and has been widely criticised by US representatives from both parties as well as basically everyone who isn't a billionaire.\n\n-----\n\nEDIT: Added Robinhood section\n\nEDIT 2: Formatting and typos"", '[removed]', ""We don't actually read every word in a sentence.

Also, because it has now slowed down it does not move back to the heart very easily, the forward pressure is much lower than in your arteries. This allows gravity to overcome them and allow blood to flow backwards (this is less common in a healthy person). The tubes in your legs that send blood back to the heart are surrounded by your leg muscles. When you walk they are squeezed and this pushes the blood back to your heart.

It's not obvious how you could sort such a list but let's say you just write down the numbers randomly.\n\nWell, this is a list that you can order 1, 2, 3 etc. Sure, it's infinite, but so is the list of counting numbers. Right now there's no obvious problem; if they're both infinite, you're good to say that they're the same size.\n\nHowever, we can do something that breaks this. Let's create a new number; the rule is that it's different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal place, and so on forever. This is definitely a real number, meaning it should be on the list, but it's definitely not on the list, since it's different from every number on the list in at least one place. Even if you added this new number to the list, you could just do this again.\n\nWhat we've done is shown that, even if we use all the counting numbers, all infinity of them, we can still create numbers that are not on that list and for which there is no matching number. There are numbers left over after we've used all the counting numbers. Even though they're both infinite, there are *more* real numbers than there are counting numbers.\n\nI hope this makes sense."", 'The concept of size that‚Äôs used for infinite sets is basically this: Two sets are the same size if you can pair the members from one up with the members of the other with no leftovers.

But you can‚Äôt do that with the set of all integers and the set of all numbers between 0 and 1.', 'The thing which helped me wrap my head around it (as much as I have) was when it was explained to me that infinity is not a number.

Vsauce did videos that explains this much better than I can in a reddit comment: [Banach‚ÄìTarski Paradox, directly related to question](https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA), and [How To Count Past Infinity](https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88)', 'Everyone\'s already pointing out the ""correct"" way to define size of infinite sets, but what many people are leaving out, which is very, VERY important, is that there is actually more than one way to define size. With your question, you\'re mixing up two different notions of size, namely [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics\\)) and [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality). This is the problem that people not into math often forget about when they spout this fact about some infinities being larger than others. If we want the discussion to have any meaning at all, we must first agree on what we mean by size.\n\nTo ELI5, think of it like this. It\'s just like how there are different ways of defining the size of an object. You can take its height, width, volume, or mass. For the purposes of analogy, let\'s focus on volume and mass. If object A has more volume than object B, that doesn\'t mean that object A is necessarily heavier than object B, especially if they\'re made up of materials with different densities, like [steel and feathers](https://youtu.be/N3bEh-PEk1g). To say that object A has a larger size than object B, it requires a clarification for whether you\'re comparing their mass or their volume. You\'ll encounter this need for clarification in baking recipes, for example, where both volume and mass are used simultaneously to specify the amounts of certain ingredients. If the recipe calls for more flour than sugar, what does it really mean by that?\n\nNow, consider what you meant in the post title, when you said that the amount of numbers in the interval [0,2] is larger than the amount in the interval [0,1]. This notion of size is analogous to what we mean by ""volume"", in the sense that the interval [0,2] takes up more space on the number line than [0,1] does. In math, we call this notion of size the [""measure""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics\\)) of the set. It is a little too complicated to explain in detail for an ELI5, but loosely speaking, it is a way of talking about how much space a set of objects take up, analogous to what everyday people refer to as volume.\n\nNow compare that to how everyone in this comments section is explaining the notion of size for infinite sets. Notice how none of their explanations bring up this idea of how much space the sets take, or if they do mention it, they emphasize that it isn\'t important. That\'s because they are NOT talking about ""measure"", but rather [""cardinality""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality). Cardinality is more about comparing how many individual items constitute the whole object. You can kind of think of this in terms of mass, though the analogy is not quite as good as that between volume and measure. To make the analogy work, you\'d have to think of mass as the amount of protons and neutrons inside of an object, which is a little silly, but it\'s the closest analogy we really have, given how much weirder cardinality is than measure. But basically, if two objects have the same number of protons+neutrons, then they have the same mass (we ignore electrons, since they weigh basically nothing in comparison). For ease of conversation, let\'s refer to protons and neutrons collectively as particles from now on. Hold on tight, as this is about to push the limits of ELI5.\n\nAlright, so how do we determine that two objects have the same mass, when defined in this silly way? Well, we could count up their particles, and then compare the numbers to see if they\'re equal. This is fine for everyday objects, since any given object in the physical world only has finitely many particles, so you can count them up just fine. What screws this up is if, for some reason, you have an object that has an infinite number of particles. Then, you can not just count them up. What you can do instead, is take one particle from object A, one particle from object B, pair them up, and then set the pair aside. You then take the next particle from A, the next from B, pair them up, and set the pair aside again. If given an infinite amount of time, you can complete this process until one of the objects run out of particles. If in the end, object B still has particles left over while object A is depleted, then we know that object B started out with more particles, so object B has a larger cardinality than object A. If they both run out at the same time, then the two objects have the same cardinality. Notice how this method circumvents having to count anything. \n\nThis is what people mean when they say that one infinity is larger than another. In terms of cardinality, there are more numbers between 0 and 1 than there are integers, for exactly this reason. When you try to pair up the integers with the numbers in [0,1], you\'ll run out of integers before you run out of numbers in [0,1]. I won\'t go over this since it\'s already been explained by others in the thread, so for a good explanation of this, refer to /u/eightfoldabyss \'s reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/h9yh9l/eli5_there_are_infinite_numbers_between_0_and_1/fuzmshh/).\n\nSo yes, one infinity can be larger than another, but what I really want you to take away from my reply is that there is more than one way to express the size of a set. Once you accept this, the fact that one infinity is larger than another will feel a lot less strange.', 'The rule is that if you can match up each number of two sets 1:1, then sets have to be the same size.  E.g. the set of whole numbers between 1 and 10 is the same size as the set of EVEN numbers between 2 and 20.  Why? Because you multiply each number in the first set by 2 and you get exactly the second set.  1 gets matched to 2, 2 get matched to 4,.... and so on.\n\nIn the same way the infinite (0, 1) set matches the set (0, 2) by multiplying each number by 2.', ""I don't know if its relevant but if you have infinite 10$ bills and on the other hand have infinite 100$ bills, their value will be the same.\nThis is why i love mathematics, still not good at it."", 'Infinity is not a number but a concept.

So endless mistaken stuff happens because people have the idea that there are arithmetic operations on integers (or rationals, reals) that yield ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù.   The most common is the idea that n/0=inf, but also concepts which boil down to there being an n such that n+1=inf or distinguishable infinities such that 2.inf_1=inf_2 where inf_1<inf_2 (or at least not equal, and distinguishable).

Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nJames B. Comey, James R. Clapper Jr. and John O. Brennan at a Senate hearing on Russia‚Äôs election interference in January 2017.CreditAl Drago/The New York Times\n\nBy\xa0David E. Sanger\xa0and\xa0Matthew Rosenberg\n\nWASHINGTON ‚Äî Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.\n\nThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n\nMr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.\n\nThe shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.\n\nOn Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin‚Äôs denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, when a reporter asked, ‚ÄúIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?‚Äù Mr. Trump shot back, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù ‚Äî directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)\n\nHours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, ‚Äúbecause he‚Äôs in charge of the country.‚Äù\n\nIn the run-up to this week‚Äôs ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.\n\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the ‚ÄúSteele dossier.‚Äù That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump‚Äôs activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.\n\nAccording to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin‚Äôs role in the election interference.\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American election.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times\n\nThey included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the\xa0Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U.\xa0had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.\n\nAnd ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin‚Äôs own role.\n\nThat included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.\n\nInstead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.\n\nThe same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called ‚Äúhand-to-hand combat‚Äù to dig in.\n\nThe pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.\n\nAfter the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said ‚ÄúRussia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries‚Äù were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations ‚Äî including the D.N.C.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump said in his statement, ‚Äúthere was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.‚Äù\n\nMr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.\n\n‚ÄúI was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,‚Äù he said in testimony in May 2017. ‚ÄúAnd they were very aggressive.‚Äù\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.\n\nMr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs loss in the election.\n\nMr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia‚Äôs election interference.\n\nOnly Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)\n\nPresident Trump, meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, said he accepted Mr. Putin‚Äôs denial of Russian election intrusions.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAnd the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.\n\nIn March, the Department of Homeland Security\xa0declared that Russia was\xa0targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.\n\nJust last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were ‚Äúblinking red‚Äù and called Russia the ‚Äúmost aggressive foreign actor, no question.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,‚Äù he said.\n\nChristopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.\n\n‚ÄúThe intelligence community‚Äôs assessment has not changed,‚Äù Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. ‚ÄúMy view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.‚Äù\n\nThe Russian efforts are ‚Äúaimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.‚Äù\n\nAlmost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia‚Äôs election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.\n\nHe dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia‚Äôs role ‚Äî and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump‚Äôs immediate orbit may have worked with them.\n\nIn July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow‚Äôs cyberskills were so good that the government‚Äôs hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure ‚Äî as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday ‚Äî he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.\n\nThat is what happened again this week, twice.\n\nMr. Trump‚Äôs statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.\n\nThat contributed to Mr. Trump‚Äôs decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered ‚Äî although he also veered off script to declare: ‚ÄúCould be other people also. A lot of people out there.‚Äù\n\n"", 'Worst president ever.', ""Taking pleasure in another person's death is a violation of our rules."", 'She reigned for 30% of the existence of the United states. \n\nMental.', ""It is so weird hearing the BBC reporters talking about the king and queen consort.

Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn\'t pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can ""spend"" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\n\n*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons!

I'm based in Poland, more info in the comments.""]","['I\'m going to address this and then lock this post because the ""shoot now ask questions later"" brigade has already showed up. Everyone here understands the need to protect yourself and your family from animal attacks. However, this is a coyote pup hiding under a chair, cowering, and obviously not well. It\'s not inside anyones home. No one is at risk of attack or harm. This animal is not acting in any threatening way. We know that some people believe in shooting every coyote or predatory animal they see, but that kind of thinking is what causes deer overpopulation, and other species populations to be off from year to year. It\'s also extremely ineffective. We\'ve had bounties on coyotes heads since the 1700\'s when the government would pay people for killing coyotes, and yet the coyotes prevail. In fact their population is doing better now than it has in over 200 years. Killing coyotes doesn\'t work. Also, shooting an animal on your own porch is messy, illegal in many municipalities, and not everyone owns a gun and has the capacity to kill. There are other options. \n\nBesides that point, this coyote is clearly young, in distress of some kind, and not a threat to anyone. If you find yourself in a situation like this and don\'t know what to do please follow these instructions:\n\n1. Do not approach the animal or try to touch it or move it. Keep a safe distance and keep children and pets far away. This is a great time to teach your children that sometimes very cute animals are dangerous and they should always stop and not attempt to interact with an unsupervised (not with a human) animal. \n\n\n2. If you are in the USA please go to www.ahnow.org and try to find a rehabber nearby who can assist you. The rehabber may not be able to pick up this animal but they will definitely know who to call and how to handle it as humanely as possible. You will not encounter a wildlife rehabber who tells you to just shoot it. They will have better options than that. \n\n\n3. Follow the rehabbers instructions. You may have to call animal control, or a game warden, and depending on the symptoms of the animal they may be planning to put the animal down. Take your kids away from the windows so they don\'t have to witness this. Collecting a wild animal and getting them into a crate can appear extremely cruel and uncaring. I assure you the catch pole, slip lead, dart is for the agents safety and the animals\' but it still appears harsh when you see it done. Not all rehabbers have rescue vehicles and staff to come out and do house calls like this one. Sometimes your local rehabber is literally one person who works out of their pole barn/outbuilding and is the only resource for 250 miles. Other times you\'ll find a well staffed wildlife rehab with tons of services available. \n\nAs far as whether or not this animal was sick or not, it\'s hard to tell by photos. Coyotes are not the main rabies vector species for any part of the USA. However, any mammal can carry rabies and the symptoms of rabies are very similar to the symptoms of canine distemper. If this animal had distemper I would expect to see goopy eyes, runny nose with mucous, confusion, drunken gait, stumbling, tripping when walking, partial or full hind end paralysis that will appear as a broken or injured back leg. You may also see them have a seizure, or just see small tremors in their feet and face. We often see what we call bubble gum seizures which causes the animal to chew over and over as though they have gum in their mouth. Rabies and distemper are both fatal diseases, and the only mercy we can offer these animals is a humane euthanasia. There are treatments for canine distemper available but none of them reverse the damage done already and that wouldn\'t be fair to the animal because he could never live wild and free again.\n\nEdit:  I want to be clear. I\'m not saying that this coyote is not dangerous. Any sick, injured, scared animal, especially wildlife is unpredictable and defensive, which means they have the potential to do harm. I meant that these people were a safe distance from the animal and were safely behind a door at that moment and protected in that way. In this case they would have had to get closer and MORE vulnerable to attack in order to dispatch this animal on their own. It made much more sense for the authorities to handle it.', 'Thanks everyone. Animal control has been called. It just seemed tired and like it was trying to hide.', 'This is concerning because it‚Äôs abnormal behavior.

Okay I‚Äôm seeing this a lot (in general, not just here) and it‚Äôs disappointing as hell. It‚Äôs like when the cat and dog meat trade gets brought up and everyone starts banging on about every other animal out there - like it somehow takes away from the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat animals‚Äù argument as a whole, when it actually strengthens it. People need to stop dragging in the argument of how animals are treated in general throughout the world - it‚Äôs all bad, animals are treated horrible everywhere. But these are NOT separate issues with separate end goals. Drawing attention to cats being skinned, vivisected, burned, cooked and dismembered alive - to name a few - and hopefully changing this, is a step forward for animals in general - not just cats as some people seem to act. It is NOT TAKING AWAY FROM OTHER ANIMALS. This is really, really important. Animal cruelty laws are basically non-existent in China. It is really, really bad. A step forward if it every happens and whether you all like it or not, probably will start with sorting out how cats and dogs are treated there. Because the fact is, if a cat - an animal which has long been considered to be both a working and a companion animal throughout the world for a very long time - can be hung up and skinned alive and then proceed to be electrocuted because it is still alive - and the cops do nothing. Then a cow or a pig, production animals humans have long farmed for food, stand no chance. We have to start somewhere. \n\nAnd on a side note, this is literal torture. This is not just killing, this is actual torture. Cartel/medieval style. Really inventive, really cruel, really barbaric. How to make something suffer the most it possibly can before it dies. This is pure evil. This is not killing something quickly to eat it. This is causing pain, fear, and suffering to a little animal, for the hell of it. \n\nPs. the example I just described - it happened to a little calico kitten. She was starved for days, then hung up by her paws and skinned alive over the course of an hour. By the end, she looked like a red earless baby otter. Her skin was on the floor in front of her. She was still alive and crying. The man proceeded to electrocute her with prods. Not only is she not the first to die this way (there‚Äôs been many) - there‚Äôs borderline equally as barbaric other ways that cats have been killed by this torture group.

The cat, Ponzu, tried to escape, but the child stepped on his leash to stop him. Ponzu eventually managed to run away but died in the park from severe injuries to his claws (his nails were ripped off from his paws when the boy dragged him around). He also had preexisting heart conditions, which could have contributed to his death. The owner angrily asked the boy why he did that. The boy ran back to his family of 8, who started insulting the cat owner: ‚ÄúThis is what you got when you walk your Fucking Cat, Bitch!‚Äù\n\nWhile another man threw her bird (a parrot named Mango) into the traffic, the dog (Tofu) was also kicked multiple times and pulled by the tail into the air. The family then jumped on the owner, kicked and choked her, pulled her hair, and tried to gouge her eye. Bystanders took a videos and came to help before the family fled the scene.\n\nTwo weeks later, the New York City Police Department changed the assigned detective three times because no one wanted to take the case.

Here is what the detective said:\n\n‚ÄúYou got assaulted because you hurt the child first, if you did not do that. The family would not jump on you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe whole thing was your fault because you did not walk away and ended the whole situation. This is why your boyfriend got assaulted and your cat died. You put the whole risky situation on your family. What kind of normal people took the cat out on the walk anyway?\n\n‚ÄúYou have to stop with the, ‚Äòthey hurt my kid.‚Äô You cannot compare a cat to a human child.

Your city sub? Nextdoor?', 'She is adorable. I am someone who will adopt another cat eventually, but not currently bc I\'m still getting over the death of the neighborhood cat I took in and cared for until he passed from lymphoma. \n\nThat said, most people care about cute photos, which is awesome. I think good photos are a good book for people. But when talking to the people around me about adopting, I like to talk about the fact that I would adopt an adult or senior cat and why. \n\nI think highlighting the cat\'s particular situation as to maybe why they are in a shelter or rescue or being fostered as an adult. basically how they came to be in your care, is a good place to start. I thought it was common knowledge that adult cats were up for adoption bc of owner surrender, owner death, adoptable TNRs, but after talking to people, even cat lovers/ pet owners, that\'s not the case and they\'ve never really thought about it much. Kittens are adopted more than adults, I think it\'s maybe 85% to 50%, something like that. I tell people that lots of adult cats were adopted from shelters as kittens and surrendered back, or adopted as a young adult and picked up on the streets years later bc they were dumped. Most people are floored, and I mean floored. (I told my neighbor, who LOVES cats but is a musician who travels so obviously doesn\'t have any, that my first cat as an adult I adopted from a friend who adopted him from a rescue as a kitten for her kids and my friend was going to surrender him back as a 2 year old bc she felt bad her kids didn\'t play with him anymore. He was in shock people do that.) Even if you don\'t know the whole background story, one aspect of it is enough. \n\nWhen people tell me to adopt a kitten, I tell them kittens are great. They are cute, very funny bc they don\'t know anything, have wild bursts of energy, etc, but I don\'t want a kitten for a variety of reasons, including the reasons why kittens so great. I want a cat that has mellowed out a bit. One that doesn\'t require hours of play to get their energy out. (I fostered a 10 month old for a night and I swear he zoomed back and forth chasing a feather flyer toy for 2 hours straight.)  Adults are still very playful but not to the extreme. Older cats have established personalities and are easier to figure out bc they aren\'t young.\n\nAnyway, when I talk to people I tell them things like all that and several people have gone from ""I\'m going to adopt a kitten in the future"" to ""I\'m going to adopt an adult cat, maybe 3, 4 or 5"". I think educating people about adult cats and being able to tell people about a cat\'s personality and why you can tell them about their personality, bc they are older and have one, is the way to go.\n\nI\'m not an actual foster person, just kind of starting, so that might not be the insight you\'re looking for but I find people that don\'t know anything about rescues or fostering or shelters don\'t know what they don\'t know. Kittens are adopted bc they are cute. You might be able to hear a little about their personality when looking to adopt but in reality this isn\'t the case. Kittens don\'t know anything and are a ball of energy. Most of the time, none of that is considered when getting a kitten. But adult cats can be adopted bc of how cute they are and bc of their personality and their demeanor. I might not have ever considered adopting a senior cat in the future but after taking in our neighborhood cat, I would definitely adopt a senior bc he was awesome and the thought of a cat like him out there sitting in a shelter or rescue forever kills me. \n\nLike I said, I\'m not a real foster person, but I am someone who has had pets and will have a pet  or two in the future so I thought all that might be helpful coming from the adopter side. Without actually knowing, I have read people who foster have success when continuously posting on things like Nextdoor and IG to keep exposure up and in my city I\'ve seen this to be true.', 'I read the pet finder ad, and you might want to change it to highlight the home she would be an ideal fit for vs the homes she wouldn‚Äôt be a great fit for.

If so, try to supply them with plenty of post ""fodder"" -- basically good quality photos, videos, info. She should be on their radar already as one who needs extra marketing due to LOS, but if the social person is like the rest of us in shelters, social is probably about 1/10th of their job, so making content as readily available as possible will help. That said, don\'t be surprised or offended if they don\'t use everything you send. Shelters often have a lot to post about, but social media is finicky and there is such a thing as posting too much, so it\'s a balancing act.\n\nConsider avenues of marketing offline, too. Maybe make fliers and hang them on community boards in grocery stores, pet supply stores, banks, and vet clinics (with the shelter\'s permission, of course). Does the shelter have a physical location? If so, maybe make a life-size cardboard cutout of her to keep at the shelter in the entryway so people can see her when they visit.

What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively \'boo\' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers. That gamers wont even be bothered to be aware/present at their biggest yearly exposition.\n\nEdit: even I can\'t believe THIS is my top rated comment. I always assumed ""RIP inbox"" was a joke.\n\nEdit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it\'s all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write \'best in E3 show!\' \'Battlefront 2 made me cry!\' \'#newEAgamelooksdope\' bias is part of their resume. \'Yes man\' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal \'reporters\' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who\'ve been in a guild, it\'s common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That\'s their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO\'s start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I\'m favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney. I agree with u/roxwar. >EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA?

That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games.

It consists of six episodes, released from 29 July 2011 to 19 June 2016 through the artists' website, YouTube and Vimeo. The series combines segments in live action, puppetry, traditional animation, and computer animation.\n\n> Each episode starts like a typical children's series, consisting of anthropomorphic puppets akin to those featured in Sesame Street and other popular children's TV programmes.

Many desert lizards and amphibians hide from the sun by going under the sand, and even going dormant to avoid using up whatever water their bodies can maintain.\n\nCurrently, alligators can undergo a kind of hibernation to avoid having to be active during particularly cold weather, but it would be an easy enough transition to simply hibernate in burrows during hot weather too. Either way, you're mostly just minimizing the amount of resources your body needs during times when using your body would be inconvenient. It'd also have more pronounced claws, or claw like appendages (nails, etc.) For digging in dry ground. \n\nThen again, a desert crocodile or alligator might adapt a longer legged , under-the-body plan to reduce surface area. Currently their bodies are splayed wide with legs radiating outward, which requires them to be a bit wide and flat. The perfect shape to absorb sunlight. Terrible for dry places.  But having legs underneath could help them adapt to being in the sun longer. But less ideal for burrowing, like I mentioned above.\n\n I feel like the burrowing/hibernation plan might be better off for a reptile.

The whole class turned and looked at me. Some stunned, some started asking if I was kidding, and some cheering. So I pulled up the video and the professor came over to me to verify. He watched about 2 seconds of it and was like ""Yup that\'s the one! Email me that right now.""  People started thanking me and asking what my favorite cookies or drink were. Some students asked how the hell I possibly found it. I got a few high fives. The professor pulled up Canvas (which is our whole course online, grades, assignments, discussions, PowerPoint, etc.) with it being projected for us all to see and made a note to ""Cancel the final exam."" He said if we want, or if campus requires us, to have a score for the final he will have a class/group final and he will help us.\n\n He then asked how I found it, and I went on to explain how I also spent hours searching without finding it, I even downloaded .tor or something like that to search on the deep web (I have no experience with the deep web so I had no idea if it would help at all or give me more options for videos so don\'t execute me over this for thinking it might work.) After I got discouraged searching the deep web I asked my roommate who is a bit more tech savvy than I hoping he might have a suggestion. He looked at me like I was stupid and said ""Dude, just get on reddit. If its an actual video and not a dream or something made up, someone on reddit WILL find it."" And well I made this post and within an hour I was close to finding the video and within 2 hours I had an actual link. \n\nThe professor just shook his head and said ""I didn\'t even think of reddit, I\'m pissed it was that easy""  He went on to show the clip of the video since it was perfect for todays subject, and continued class as normal with PowerPoint. A couple times throughout the lecture he caught himself saying ""This will be on the exam..."" then catch himself ""oh wait, there is no exam"" and he\'d point at me, followed by a few more cheers.\n\nSo my classmates and I thank you all, and for everyone\'s help with all of your suggestions, upvotes, and time!', ""Oh I know this!

I rarely meet anyone with similar ancestry. Please allow me to entertain:\n\nIn the early 1700s a ton of Germans immigrated to Russia in the area that is today Ukraine and Crimea. They were invited by Catherine the Great to populate Russian lands with skilled farmers and workers. They undertook a 2000+ mile journey by train and covered wagons from Germany to Russia.\n\nMany communities of Germans opted to move here... there were a few distinct groups. There were the Mennonites, the Catholics, and even a few Protestants (evangalisch). A lot of them were seeking religious freedom (or isolation). These Germans setup somewhat closed communities where their own distinct cultures flourished. There were the Volga Germans, the Black-Sea Germans, and the Bessarabien Germans just to name a few. This land became their new ""Volga Heimat.""\n\nWhen these Germans immigrated to Russia they were originally given the privilege of maintaining their German citizenship, being exempt from Russian conscription, and a number of other things. One caveat is that they never owned their land - it was just on lease from Russia.\n\nI can\'t remember which Alexander, but the Tsar started taking away these benefits and started  conscripting these Germans into the Russian Army. The theme in Russia at the time was very anti-foreigner. A lot of things started changing and people started to leave these lands again in the late 1800s, early 1900s. Many immigrated to the Great Plains in the USA (which mirrored the climate of the Russian Steppes) and were very successful farmers due to their techniques they brought with them. Others immigrated back to Germany, some to Canada (Sasketchewan), and some to Argentina. \n\nThose that stayed didn\'t get to stay for very long. Many non-Russians were deported to Siberia, and from there to Kazakhstan. At one point there was almost an autonomous German state in Kazakhstan! Since then I think the Germans and local populations have merged.\n\nSo all this to say that today there is a very distinct ethnicity that is [German-Russian](https://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/history_culture/index.html). \n\nDocumentary - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vbKf9vyB9E **highly recommended, please watch**\n\nThe accordion and polka is what we grew up with - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddqOLR3T44Y\n\nAnyways...

I hope it includes an interesting story.', 'I guess I\'ll post my thoughts.\n\nSplash Mountain is my favorite ride in Magic Kingdom, probably third overall with Rise of the Resistance recently moving ahead of it. I don\'t think I hold Splash to that regard due to its story or theming if I\'m being honest. I think it is a brilliant engineering feat, a fantastic and *lengthy* ride track, and the ride is simply never boring. How many rides are basic-dark-ride-with-drop-at-the-end? Splash is great because there\'s lots of little drops (though not so little) that are fun and feel different from every other one. And then the ride brilliantly builds up to the big drop at the end for a legit thrill in a park that obviously leans more child-friendly.\n\nI think all of that is true regardless of whether it\'s themed to lite-Song of the South, or Princess and the Frog, or whatever else. The only thing that\'s a slight travesty imo is losing Zip a Dee Doo Dah, a forever classic Disney song. I don\'t know if that can still be worked into the attraction in some way, maybe plays throughout Frontierland, or whatever. Other than that, let\'s be real, *no one* is a diehard Song of the South fan, Brer Rabbit/Fox/Bear/Frog were *never* fan favorite characters (I\'m sure someone out there loves them), the story of Brer Rabbit leaving to find his happy place only to realize he\'s lived there all along isn\'t *that* compelling.\n\nAs for Princess and the Frog, I always thought that movie kind of got the shaft, so I like seeing it get love. I know marketing blamed the title, their logic being that boys would not want to see a princess movie but the generic titles ""Frozen"" and ""Moana"" don\'t have that effect even though those are equally princess movies. I do wonder how they\'re going to build up the final drop story-wise. They also bill this as a kind of sequel to the movie, but if I remember correctly Frozen Ever After was described in the same way, and FEA is almost scene-for-scene the original Frozen movie. I\'m really sick of attractions that are just scene-for-scene the movie rather than a true original story. Part of the reason Rise of the Resistance worked so well for me (among 1000 other amazing feats).\n\nIs this the right thing to do? I don\'t know. I\'m a boring, straight, white man so I can only listen to truly affected people\'s thoughts. I always thought Splash Mountain being solely based around the cartoon part of Song of the South was ""good enough"" for avoiding the idiotic and racist reimagining of reconstruction era that the live-action part of the movie did. But ""good enough"" is perhaps not good enough. Tbh I\'m surprised Disney pulled the trigger on this not just because it isn\'t an obvious this-is-horrible-get-rid-of-it-asap kind of thing, but with how much money it will cost amidst the shutdowns and tourism crash as well. This is not an easy or empty move by Disney, it really isn\'t.\n\nRandom additional thoughts:\n\n* Please keep the FSU squirrel.\n* Please keep the hidden mickey bobber, it\'s legitimately one of my favorite hidden mickeys.\n* The animatronics throughout the ride have all seen much better days. I know they\'re almost *historic*, but if they aren\'t willing to maintain them then their time has probably come.\n* Will they keep the name Splash Mountain? It\'ll be weird if it doesn\'t considering the Mountain naming amongst the big thrill rides in the park. I guess Tron also bucks that trend.\n* If they put real effort into the ending Mardi Gras scene (and not just touching up the barely-functioning animatronics) then that could actually be a *really* cool scene.', 'Good to see Tony Baxter on the creative team!', 'Obviously Splash Mountain is a classic, but I feel like Disney could do really well with this if they incorporate the culture of New Orleans into it!', ""Reminder: If you love Splash it'll still be around in Tokyo."", ""I'm absolutely gutted and heartbroken.

I just returned from Disney World and can say from first hand experience that the place is a probably already a viral epicenter.   There are a TON of practices in place which would help accelerate the spread of coronavirus, rather than curb it.  For example:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Shuttles are packed to capacity and there is almost always someone coughing, sneezing, snotting all over the place.\n* Just getting into the park requires a fingerprint scan, so you're starting off your day sharing germs with everyone else who touched the same scanner.\n* Bag checks involve a Disney employee sticking their hands in every compartment of your bag, touching everything inside in the process... right after they just did the same thing with the last bag, and the one before that, etc.  They did not use hand sanitizer between bags.\n* Every ride with a seat belt has a yellow fabric strap on it that they make you tug on to show the belt is latched.... germ city.\n* On most rides, people waiting in line are encouraged to pack in tightly and use up all available space in order to fit as many people inside the queue as possible.\n* For any of the shows, people are once again encouraged to pack tightly together.  Once the shows end, it also results in a tightly packed crowd trying to exit the area.\n* We didn't encounter a single credit card machine at the park or resort that had a chip reader.  Every time we paid for something with a credit card, the person behind the counter would ask to take the card from us, swipe it, then hand it back.  Started just using our magic bands for everything we could.\n* At the resort, everyone was running around with refillable mugs which are likely covered in germs and coming in contact with every drink machine they refill from.\n* Plasticware / silverware at various food stops and restaurants were sat directly on the tables, put in bins requiring people to fish one out with their bare hands (touching several others in the process), or dispensed out of machines that required pressing a lever to release a utensil.  The dispensing machine seemed to be the safest option, until I saw an employee refilling one and sitting the bundled stacks of utensils on a dirty counter top.\n* The last night we were there, we saw several cast members at the entry points / security checkpoints high-fiving people as they left the park after closing, wearing large fabric gloves that appeared to be Mickey hands.\n\nWe were SUPER careful and paranoid about germs the entire time there, but there's just no avoiding them completely.  Hand washing and sanitizer can only go so far.  There was just no way to avoid being exposed without simply not going at all.\n\nNot to mention, the average adult at the park doesn't seem to have any concept of proper hygiene.  We regularly saw people coughing into their hands (if they coughed into anything at all), picking their noses, shoving food into their mouths using dirty hands, touching everything, etc.\n\nWe knew it was a calculated risk to go, but we were honestly shocked at just how bad it was.  We were also surprised at how many elderly people we saw there, considering how high risk it is for them.  Being in our 30s, the risk is considerably less, but kind of wishing we had not gone.

When every other form of protest fails, it is the final, irrevocable cry of the silenced.\n\nWynn was not, in my opinion, mentally ill. The only reason his act seems so bizarre and alien as to be insane is that so few today can imagine being so committed to an ideal as to be willing to give your life to it. His only abnormality was that when he says he is committed to changing the world, he means it.\n\nI don‚Äôt love that I have taken the role of speaker for the dead; I wish I had more of his own words I could leave here to show to you his commitment and sanity. But with so many here speaking ill of his choice I feel obligated to defend his sacrifice and, maybe, let his final call ring that much clearer.\n\nSo now, when you feel this horror, and hurt, and fear, and confusion - when you see the inevitable pictures and are disgusted and revolted - do not let yourself look away. Do not let yourself say ‚Äúhe must have been crazy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wish he had found help‚Äù or any of these other ways of milding that grief.

The author of this article, Carey Gilliam, is one of those who frequently profits off of fear mongering regardless of what the science says.\n\nThe article is just dripping with standard attempts to mislead that come up often in the topic. First, she‚Äôs trying to claim it‚Äôs linked to cancer while leaving out almost all scientific agencies say otherwise. Like in climate change denial, you‚Äôll find people cherry-picking on those, especially referencing the WHO, while leaving it‚Äôs a heavily criticized branch of it while also omitting that the other branches disagree.\n\nShe also doesn‚Äôt mention anything about how glyphosate is processed by the body. One of the key things for glyphosate‚Äôs safety profile is that it is readily excreted in urine instead of staying in the body. Instead, she keeps it all purposely vague.\n\nThen she goes on to vaguely say detectable traces were found. This is a very common tactic to omit what the actual risk was when you can detect a chemical well below concerning levels, but still want to drum up the scare factor. This tactic has been heavily criticized in the literature when other groups, like the EWG, repeatedly use it for propaganda instead of science: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135239/\n\nThen she goes on to cherry-pick a contrarian author claiming a link to cancer again.\n\nNow that I‚Äôm at the very end of the article, it even says it was co-written with the EWG. That‚Äôs a huge red flag for any of us environmentally focused scientists.\n\nFor those of us doing actual work in the field, we‚Äôre both having to combat actual issues as well as quacks like this trying to put their anti-GMO spin on. It gets tiring after awhile dealing with the deluge of this misinformation in good subjects.', ""They report a detection threshold for glyphosate of 0.2 nanograms per millilitre, or 0.0002 parts per million or 0.2 parts per ~~~trillion~~~ billion.\n\nSo they could detect at least 0.000177 milligrams of glyphosate evenly distributed throughout the body of an average US male (88.7 kg). \n\n They used 2D-on-line ion chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (IC- MS/MS) and isotope dilution quantification. \n\nThe detection levels are extremely low.\n\nThey report 1885 out of 2310 samples were above the detection threshold. I don't see what the levels were, however."", 'So the EPA states that it‚Äôs likely non carcinogenic‚Ä¶.but they gave no details about their process of this.

This may also be why young people who have no gluten allergies as a kid develop it as they get older with more exposure to regular wheat.', 'Is this enough glyphosate to cause health problems, though?', 'I read the article and it was just for one day.

The main issue with renewables is sometimes there is so much of it in a certain area that can\'t be ""moved"" through the power lines that they have to get rid of it somehow.  They have something called ""the world\'s largest toaster"" that they can turn on literally that is just massive coils of wire that are used to burn off the excess power in an area.
